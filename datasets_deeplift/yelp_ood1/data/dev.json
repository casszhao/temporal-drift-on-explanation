        "full text doc": "i was pretty excited about this place. it is the newest addition to the graduate hospital area ( and i also live like 4 blocks away ). they have a packed downstairs as well as an upstairs area that is well decorated and feels like a hip home. it's still fairly new, but if you want to come here - you should definitely make reservations. the reason i gave this place 2 stars is mainly because of the food. i ordered a burrito the first time, which was relatively cheap ( on the order of 10 dollars ), but it was just very bland and uninspired. the drinks were good ( we got a pitcher of their house margarita ), but the food just weighed the whole experience down. overall, i'm excited that we have a new mexican spot close by, but hopefully their menu will improve as they get settled."

        "full text doc": "i was looking for a spot to get regular massages since i just moved to the area and was hoping the massage loft would be the place. i'm not 100 % sure if i'll return, mostly because my massage was cut short. the massage itself was pretty good, i felt at times not enough pressure was used. overall, my muscles were less tense and more relaxed after, so that was a plus. my massage therapist was very nice and made some conversation with me. however, i was really disappointed to only get 45 minutes of my 52 minutes massage ( per the website ). i was told that i did not have to come early to my appointment as i was the first one of the day, so i arrived only a few minutes early. they had me fill out a form and then i waited for about 10 minutes on the table after undressing, i'd estimate that between the time i arrived and the massage actually started was about 15 minutes. at the end of my massage, i checked the time and was really disappointed that it had been only 1 hour since i arrived exactly, meaning i didn't get 15 % of the time i paid for. i may come back if they have any deals as i did enjoy the ambian"

        "full text doc": "i've been here many, many times but primarily to partake in adult beverages while sitting outside, but after restaurants started opening back up for outdoor seating i thought this would be a great place to take the family. they have great outdoor seating, such cute glider chairs. unfortunately we were not sat there, but were thankful to be dining out. service was great, food was good, and prices are reasonable. my husband and i split a salad and sandwich. we ordered the palm beach salad. it had crab, shrimp, avocado, tomatoes, and a hard boiled egg. it was refreshing and pretty big. the sandwiched we ordered was the brisket with provolone and bbq. it was so tender. my daughter and her friend both ordered the raviolis and they gulped then down. we ended the meal with no one, but two desserts. we ordered the brownie sundae and turtle cheesecake. i tried not to eat too much but that cheesecake was outstanding. great first meal out in pa as a family post quarantine."

        "full text doc": "the recommendation from our local tiki guide was that chopper was the place to go for drinks. we were not disappointed! our visit took place during covid and was one of the first opportunities we've had to sit at the bar and watch the bartender work in months. with a massive three - sided bar that occupies much of the main room, we were able to sit far enough away and still enjoy a great view of the interior. the look of chopper is a departure from your standard tiki bar. rather than polynesian decor, the look is much more mesoamerican with a heavy robot tilt which i took to calling mechoamerican. the huge toy robot suspended above the bar with its laser - cut texture was particularly enjoyable! they'd gone all - in on the mandalorian when we were there as well. the drinks were superb! we had a couple standards ( zombie and mai tai ) before stretching into one of our new favorites, tiger milk. a hot drink that was smooth, flavorful and completely enjoyable! they also have bar - specific mugs for sale for collectors like us, so bonus! the food menu is pretty limited and we didn't try anything here. great spot and i'd definitely come here"

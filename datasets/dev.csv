1,"hillary clinton ’ s health has been the subject of intense speculation during the 2016 presidential campaign , in part because the candidates ’ fitness to serve is of valid concern to voters , and in part because it was seized upon by her opponents as a way to undermine her candidacy . <PARA> while presidential candidates aren ’ t required by law to release information about their medical histories , it has become routine for them to do so , and both democratic candidate clinton and republican candidate trump have provided physician ’ s <MASK> attesting to their good health . despite this , <MASK> to the effect that clinton is suffering from some kind of serious , undisclosed medical condition continue to run rampant . <PARA> the <MASK> released by clinton ’ s personal doctor , lisa bardack , md of mount kisco , new york , lists past bouts of deep vein thrombosis ( blood clots ), an elbow fracture , and a concussion , plus ongoing conditions of hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies . though her family medical <MASK> includes heart disease and stroke , a cardiac screening was conducted in 2015 and came back negative . so did a cancer screening . “[ clinton ] is in excellent physical condition ,” bardack concluded , “ and fit to serve as president of the united <MASK> .” <PARA> we note that dr . bardack ’ s assessment ( which she reaffirmed in writing in august 2016 ) was based on an actual physical examination of the candidate — not a minor consideration , given that much of the speculation about clinton ’ s health has been fueled by “ diagnoses ” from afar by physicians who have never shaken her hand , much less conducted a thorough examination of her . <PARA> media personality “ dr . drew ” pinsky , for one , delivered a rambling assessment of clinton ’ s health on a radio talk show in which he repeatedly <MASK> he had “ grave concerns ” about her medical fitness — based on nothing more than having read dr . bardack ’ s two -

induced dyskinesia , or pd lid .” <PARA> but no , it ’ s not . as we reported previously , the journalists surrounding her at that moment saw nothing amiss or disturbing in her actions . associated press reporter lisa lerer described it as follows : <PARA> in closing , we wish to make it clear what our aim has been in this analysis . we have not tried to make the case that hillary clinton does not have parkinson ’ s disease ( in point of fact , we don ’ t think that case even needs making ). rather , we have shown that what ted noel did in this video is systematically misrepresent perfectly ordinary and explicable phenomena as “ parkinson ’ s disease symptoms ,” and his motivation for doing so was purely political .",2016-09-09T07:00:00+00:00,train_151,train,misinfo
1,"an account of a purse snatching at a john lewis ( a large department store with its headquarters in london ’ s oxford street ) which led to a burglary began its online life in november 2008 : <PARA> while this particular account can ’ t be verified ( precious little information is provided in terms of the who , when and where , details necessary to the process of tracking down the incident ), the implied advice about not stowing one ’ s purse on the hook affixed to the door of a restroom stall is valid . handbags have indeed been snatched from the stalls of public restrooms by thieves who reached over closed doors and lifted them from the hooks the stalls ’ occupants had placed them on . <PARA> this form of thievery is so commonplace that some airports have taken the precaution of removing the hooks from stall doors , as , for instance , the san francisco international airport did in 1994 in response to fourteen such thefts . ( the thieves countered by replacing them with self - sticking plastic hooks .) the best method of safeguarding one ’ s purse while in a public restroom stall is to place the handbag on the floor , then place one foot through its strap . <PARA> as for the second part of the tale ( about the victim ’ s home being broken into when she went to retrieve her purse ), bill cain , an instructor for the national crime prevention task force in atlanta , said in a 2004 seminar that some purse snatchers have been known to telephone their victims later , saying they stole the handbags on dares and wanted to return them . when a victim would go to a designated site to retrieve her purse , the thieves would burglarize her house . <PARA> the majority of burglars prefer to go about their business while the home is unoccupied . some even choose which domiciles to burgle based on knowledge that the residents will be elsewhere at the time of the break - ins ( e . g ., those who select their targets via the obituary pages ). it pays , therefore , to be wary of a phone call promising the return of a misplaced or stolen purse , lest such call be naught but a ruse to get the householder out of the way . <PARA> however , while lures have been successfully used to get people out their homes so that their residences can be rifled , the premise of clearing a householder out of the way by sending her on a wild goose chase to <MASK> a purse has one inherent flaw : it assumes that with her gone , the targeted house will now be standing empty . therefore , if you ever do misplace a handbag or have one snatched from you and subsequently receive a call from someone asking you to retrieve the recovered bag , make the caller aware that the home has other occupants who will be staying in place while you ’ re off <MASK> your property , even if that means temporarily inventing a spouse and some children ( e . g ., “ oh , yes , i can certainly come get it . i ’ ll ask my husband to watch the kids while i ’ m gone ”). <PARA> a well - traveled urban legend fits the “ one theft facilitating a subsequent burglary ” pattern of the handbag tale . in the “ ticket taker “ legend , a stolen car is returned to its owners , with the thief leaving in it a note and some theater tickets by way of an apology . but of course the tickets prove to be just a way of emptying the targeted home so that it can be burgled . <PARA> a july 2009 version of the e - mail <MASK> above contained the signature block of dc nick gilbey of the violent and organised crime unit at the plumstead police <MASK> in the u . k . that officer said about the item that “ it didn ’ t <MASK> from me and it ’ s a hoax . please disregard the email and do not refer to it .”",2009-01-03T01:09:56+00:00,train_4182,train,misinfo

0,"<MASK> : the infamous “ catfish ” incident that resulted in several of elvis presley ’ s backup singers walking off stage in the middle of a concert was not merely a matter of their taking offense at a racist remark , but a reaction to the singer ’ s increasingly bizarre behavior . <PARA> the tragic pattern of elvis ’ final years are familiar to nearly everyone . his ongoing misuse of an astonishing variety and volume of prescription <PARA> drugs turned his concert appearances into parodies staged by a sloppy , bloated performer who slurred lyrics rather than singing them , changed his character , caused him to act in an increasingly incomprehensible and erratic manner , and destroyed his health ( ultimately killing him ). presley ’ s behavior during a july 1975 performance in norfolk , virginia , was one of the low points in his long decline from superb entertainer to drug - sodden corpse . <PARA> elvis ’ retinue of backup singers in 1975 consisted of soprano kathy westmoreland , who had joined presley ’ s concert ensemble in 1969 ; the sweet inspirations , a quartet of black female gospel singers who had also been with elvis ’ touring group since 1970 ; and j . d . sumner and the stamps , a white male quintet who had replaced the imperials , a similar quintet , back in 1971 . kathy westmoreland had had a relationship with elvis , and when she refused to pick up where they had left off during a concert tour earlier that year and started dating a member of the band , he began to introduce her at performances using “ a string of veiled and not - so - veiled sexual references .” he once again began riding westmoreland during the summer 1975 tour , telling audiences , among other things , that she would “ take affection from anybody , anyplace , anytime . in fact , she gets it from the whole band .” her <MASK> only seemed to increase presley ’ s determination to embarrass her . <PARA> matters came to a head during an evening performance in norfolk . early on in the show , according to a upi report , elvis told the <PARA> audience that “ he smelled green peppers and onions and that his backup singers , the sweet inspirations , had probably been eating catfish .” the main issue was not that his backup singers took offense at what they perceived as a racist remark . as presley biographer peter guralnick wrote , “ neither kathy nor the sweets knew exactly what he meant by the ‘ catfish ’ remark ; none of them thought it was racial — they just knew it was hostile , and there was an ugly undertone not just to that comment but to his whole demeanor .” estelle brown , one of the sweet inspirations responded to his remark by hanging her head , and elvis continued by <MASK> , “ estelle , sweet inspirations , stamps , if you don ’ t look up , i ’ m going to kick your ass .” at that point estelle brown had had enough and walked off the stage . when elvis glowered at the remaining singers and said , “ sorry for any embarrassment i might have caused , but if you can ’ t take it , get off the pot ,” another inspiration , sylvia shemwell , walked out , followed by kathy westmoreland . <PARA> the departed inspirations performed at the next night ’ s show in greensboro after elvis apologized , but kathy westmoreland did not . “ i thought it was funny ,” was the only explanation elvis offered for his strange and insulting behavior the night before . presley ’ s on - stage behavior became increasingly bizarre , and on the final night of the tour he took requests , threw his guitar into the crowd , and gave away a $ 6 , 500 ring to an audience member . it was all symptomatic of the drug - induced physical decline that would culminate in elvis ’ death from an overdose two years later . <PARA> although the whole incident was not so simply explained , “ black backup singers walked out after elvis said they ‘ smelled like catfish '” is the memory the public has retained of an evening best forgotten .",2010-01-11T17:21:14+00:00,train_1794,train,info

contra testimony . incidents such as these led to speculation that he was undergoing a gradual mental decline that those around him didn ’ t want to admit . a 1987 <MASK> in the new republic posed the troubling question outright : “ is reagan senile ?” <PARA> that was precisely what cbs news reporter lesley stahl was asking herself during a 1986 visit with a president she would later describe in her 2000 memoir , reporting live , as “ shriveled ” and verging on catatonic . <PARA> “ reagan didn ’ t seem to know who i was ,” she wrote . “ he gave me a distant look with those milky eyes and shook my hand weakly . oh , my , he ’ s gonzo , i thought .” but a few minutes later , he snapped out of it and from that point on seemed perfectly fine . when asked , white house aides admitted to stahl that they had witnessed similar episodes . <PARA> even reagan ’ s own son , ron , sensed something was wrong at the time . he wrote in his 2011 book , my father at 100 : a memoir , that he first became concerned that “ something beyond mellowing ” was afflicting his father three years into reagan ’ s first term . of the latter ’ s bumbling debate performance against walter mondale in 1984 , the younger reagan observed : <PARA> but ron reagan isn ’ t a physician , much less one trained to diagnose the symptoms of alzheimer ’ s disease . his half - brother michael reagan vehemently disagreed with ron ’ s armchair diagnosis and accused him of trying to “ sell out his father to sell books .” <PARA> ron later softened his <MASK> in remarks to the new york times , insisting <MORE> in office , but rather that the disease was “ likely present in him ” long before it was diagnosed . experts say physiological and neurological changes linked to alzheimer ’ s start showing up in the brain years before outward symptoms appear . <PARA> however , the physicians who directly attended ronald reagan while he was president agreed unanimously that he never displayed signs or symptoms of dementia the whole time he was in office , the new york times reported in 1997 : <PARA> although no cognitive tests were administered to reagan during his time in office ( his doctors saw no need for them ), he did begin receiving annual mental and psychological assessments in 1990 , after undergoing surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain . the four - hour battery of tests , which would have detected signs of dementia , found nothing amiss for the first three years they were administered . “ all parameters for his age absolutely were within the normal range ,” one of reagan ’ s doctors said . it was reagan himself who announced the diagnosis of alzheimer ’ s in 1994 . <PARA> there were certainly no indications of dementia ( age , perhaps , but not dementia ) when the 81 - year - old former president delivered a 35 - minute speech at the 1992 republican national convention , a performance washington post reporter bob woodward described as “ flawless .” <PARA> it must also be said that given that the average life expectancy of a patient diagnosed with alzheimer ’ s disease is eight to 10 years , reagan , who died in 2004 ( 10 years after his diagnosis ), would have been extraordinarily long - lived for an alzheimer ’ s patient if he was already suffering from the disease , as some <MASK> , in 1984 . <PARA> two academic studies , one published in 1988 and the other in 2015 , analyzed transcripts and recordings of reagan speaking in debates and press conferences to see if his speech patterns betrayed otherwise imperceptible signs of cognitive decline . <PARA> the first , which compared reagan ’ s speech patterns to those of other politicians , found that reagan had “ significantly higher levels of cognitive impairment scores ” than other subjects in the study ( including president carter and vice president mondale ). the second found that changes in reagan ’ s speaking patterns known to be associated with the onset of dementia were detectable “ years before clinical diagnosis .” <PARA> but although these findings indicate that reagan did display subtle linguistic signs of cognitive decline while still president , they are experimental and do not suffice to push back the post - presidency diagnosis of alzheimer ’ s into his time in office . visar berisha , assistant professor of science and hearing at arizona <MASK> university and the lead researcher in the 2015 study told us :",2018-01-18T20:19:28+00:00,train_2389,train,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : a number of hollywood actors have been famously associated with signature phrases repeated across many years by legions by imitators — lines that , although they may not actually have been repetitions <PARA> of words spoken by those actors in any of the films they ever appeared in , were nonetheless able to conjure up the essence of a given actor ’ s cadence and verbal trademark . some common examples include cary grant ’ s “ judy , judy , judy ” triad , jimmy cagney ’ s snarling “ mmmmm , you dirty rat !” and bette davis ’ waving her cigarette holder around while <MASK> “ peter , peter , peter !” <PARA> in the case of actor tony curtis , the line most famously associated with him is one which was “ intended to be derisive , highlighting his working - class bronx accent and , by extension , his limitations as an actor .” that line , according to legend , stemmed from one of the many costume dramas curtis appeared in during the earlier days of his film career , one with a medieval setting which provided the set - up for curtis ’ character to approach a structure from a distance and <MASK> , “ yondah lies da castle of my foddah ” — a legend repeated by , among others , the new york sun in 2008 : <PARA> the jewish kid from the bronx , bernie schwartz , [ was ] the guy who wore a dress in his most popular movie and whose most famous line in a film can ’ t be recited without inciting snickers : “ yonder lies the castle of my fad - dah .” <PARA> i always thought that this line was apocryphal , [ b ] ut it really is a line from a movie , “ the black shield of falworth ” ( 1954 ), a kitschy swashbuckler that mr . curtis made with his wife at the time , janet leigh . though it was , like most of mr . curtis ’ s 1950s films , a box - office hit , it is scarcely remembered today . <PARA> i always thought that this line was apocryphal , [ b ] ut it really is a line from a movie , “ the black shield of falworth ” ( 1954 ), a kitschy swashbuckler that mr . curtis made with his wife at the time , janet leigh . though it was , like most of mr . curtis ’ s 1950s films , a box - office hit , it is scarcely remembered today . <PARA> in these days of youtube and other video sharing sites , one would expect to find numerous clips online documenting tony curtis ’ delivery of this infamous line , but those who seek such confirmation invariably come away disappointed . that ’ s because curtis never uttered any such words : not <MORE> unjustly made fun of for years afterward . there ’ s a scene where i ’ m on horseback and piper is sitting next to me , and i say to her , “ yonder in the valley of the sun is my father ’ s castle [ sic ].” <PARA> after the film came out , debbie reynolds , who would later marry eddie fisher , went on television and said , “ did you see the new guy in the movies ? they call him tony curtis , but that ’ s not his real name . in his new movie he ’ s got a hilarious line where he says , ‘ yonder lies the castle of my fodda .'” <PARA> you could chalk up her ridicule up to my new york accent , but when she mentioned the issue of my real name on television , i began to wonder if there was something anti - semitic going on there . i ’ m probably just hypersensitive on that topic . but either way , she got the line wrong ! unfortunately , her version stuck with the public , and for a while it became popular for people to <MASK> the incorrect line in a ridiculous new york accent . <PARA> years later , hugh hefner came up to me at a party and said , “ yonder lies the castle of my fodda .'” <PARA> i looked at him coolly . “ hef , i never said that .” <PARA> “ then don ’ t tell anybody ,” he said . “ it makes a great movie <MASK> .” <PARA> after the film came out , debbie reynolds , who would later marry eddie fisher , went on television and said , “ did you see the new guy in the movies ? they call him tony curtis , but that ’ s not his real name . in his new movie he ’ s got a hilarious line where he says , ‘ yonder lies the castle of my fodda .'” <PARA> you could chalk up her ridicule up to my new york accent , but when she mentioned the issue of my real name on television , i began to wonder if there was something anti - semitic going on there . i ’ m probably just hypersensitive on that topic . but either way , she got the line wrong ! unfortunately , her version stuck with the public , and for a while it became popular for people to <MASK> the incorrect line in a ridiculous new york accent . <PARA> years later , hugh hefner came up to me at a party and said , “ yonder lies the castle of my fodda .'” <PARA> i looked at him coolly . “ hef , i never said that .” <PARA> “ then don ’ t tell anybody ,” he said . “ it makes a great movie <MASK> .”",2014-06-05T20:34:18+00:00,dev_957,dev,misinfo

0,"actual occurrences can sometimes take on folkloric lives of their own , making the shift from news stories to cautionary tales through emotional responses to elements of those events . that was the case with the 4 june 1999 death of 12 - year - old catherine “ casey ” fish , who did indeed die while playing the marshmallow - stuffing game known as “ chubby bunny ” — descriptions of her death have become part of the cautionary lore spread among parents . <PARA> the rules of “ chubby bunny ” require competitors to enunciate that phrase with marshmallows stuffed in their mouths . no swallowing or chewing is allowed , and any participant who gags , coughs , or spits is “ out ” of the game . the winner is whichever child manages to utter the expression through the largest number of marshmallows . <PARA> casey fish choked on four marshmallows and collapsed during the annual care fair held at hoffman elementary school , a grade school in chicago ’ s north shore area , and died at the glenbrook hospital a few hours later . the “ chubby bunny ” competition was to have been part of the day ’ s activities and would have been supervised by a teacher . however , casey began playing the game with some of her friends when her teacher momentarily left the area ten minutes before the scheduled start of the “ chubby bunny ” competition to have a word with a janitor . as casey choked , the teacher was summoned back to the room , but he arrived too late to head off the youngster ’ s death . <PARA> casey ’ s death was reported by the media at the time of the incident . but , unlike many news stories about the death of a child , the deceased sixth - grader ’ s <MASK> was told and retold in ensuing months , primarily via the oprah winfrey show , which talked about the case ( including airing interviews with the distraught parents ) in january , march , and june 2000 . the tale of how casey ’ s life ended continued to surface in the news as her parents pursued a civil suit against the school district , asserting that a failure to properly supervise the children led to the death of their daughter . ( in 2005 , her parents settled their lawsuit for $ 2 million .) all of this additional attention served to keep the <MASK> in circulation . <PARA> the folkloric shift this real - life tragedy has taken involves the mode of death . while a very real youngster did indeed lose her life through playing “ chubby bunny ,” she did so through choking on the intact confections in her mouth , not ( as developing lore would have it ) via the marshmallows ’ somehow breaking down to form a windpipe - clogging glue . in the example <MASK> above , the bonbons were said to have “ emulsified ” — that is , turned into a liquid mass . another internet - spread description of the death says “ the marshmallows were heated in the mouth and throat and effectively turned into a sticky enough substance that it could not be removed by conventional attempts at first aid .” yet another version <MASK> that “ the marshmallows , warming - up to body temperature , took on the form of her air passage , and choked her to death .” we know the marshmallows did not eventually turn into a sticky , fatal mass after casey held them in her mouth for a while because , during the lawsuit brought by casey ’ s parents , casey ’ s best friend testified seeing her pal ’ s lips turn purple just a few seconds after she had put the marshmallows into her mouth . <PARA> while marshmallows can be quickly melted into a thick liquid , goopy substance in a pot on the stove ( as anyone who has made rice krispies squares will attest ), the temperature inside the human mouth is not sufficient to reduce them to that <MASK> . absent chewing or licking , a marshmallow can be held in one ’ s mouth approximately 15 minutes before it entirely disappears , its bulk gradually dissolving and being swallowed across the span of that quarter hour . at no point in that process does the resultant fluid become thick or gluey — it is thin , watery , and easily swallowed . <PARA> the danger presented by the game comes not from the marshmallows being rendered into a suffocating goo in the human mouth by the heat of that environment , but from their bulk . in the zeal to best others , a child may stuff more of the confections into his mouth than he can cope with , potentially lodging one in his throat where it will block his windpipe the way a cork would . it is not any special “ melting ” property inherent to marshmallows that makes the game hazardous , but rather that the marshmallows take up so much space , and their consistency makes them difficult to remove either via the heimlich maneuver or with medical instruments . <PARA> on 13 september 2006 , another “ chubby bunny ” death occurred when a 32 - year - old janet rudd choked on a marshmallow and collapsed while participating in the game at a fair in london , ontario . emergency crews were unable to remove the blockage from her throat at the scene ; she was taken to a hospital where she was revived , but she died later that evening .",2006-03-17T08:00:00+00:00,test_1176,test,info

the - board cuts ( known as “ sequestration ”) to go into effect . <PARA> the super - committee did not agree on a deficit reduction plan , <MASK> that “ after months of hard work and intense deliberations , we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to make any bipartisan agreement available to the public before the committee ’ s deadline ,” so unless and until lawmakers can agree on a solution to the budget impasse , the sequestration budget cuts are set to take effect <PARA> with the 2013 budget . since those cuts , if they take place , may include large reductions in pentagon spending , some defense contractors are anticipating that they may have to engage in significant layoffs of personnel in the upcoming year , and under the worker adjustment and retraining notification ( warn ) act , enacted in 1989 , most employers with 100 or more employees are required to issue 60 - day advance notification of mass layoffs . <PARA> when one such defense contractor , lockheed martin , announced on 1 october 2012 that it would abide by white house guidance not to issue warn act - mandated layoff notices to thousands of employees just before the november presidential election , republican critics contended that president obama was engaging in a partisan political ploy to protect votes in a key battleground <MASK> ( lockheed martin has a large business presence in virginia ) at the expense of workers who might soon find themselves without jobs : <PARA> u . s . <MORE> our employees are provided fair treatment and appropriate notice , if their jobs are impacted by sequestration . on friday afternoon the u . s . office of management and budget ( omb ) and the department of defense ( dod ) released guidance clarifying responsibilities under the warn act and outlining their timeline for making sequestration - related program decisions . <PARA> after careful review of the additional guidance provided by the office of management and budget and the department of defense , we will not issue sequestration - related warn notices this year . the additional guidance offered important new information about the potential timing of dod actions under sequestration , indicating that dod anticipates no contract actions on or about 2 january , 2013 , and that any action to adjust funding levels on contracts as a result of sequestration would likely not occur for several months after 2 jan . the additional guidance further ensures that , if contract actions due to sequestration were to occur , our employees would be provided the protection of the warn act and that the costs of this protection would be allowable and recoverable . <PARA> we remain firm in our conviction that the automatic and across - the - board budget reductions under sequestration are ineffective and inefficient public policy that will weaken our civil government operations , damage our national security , and adversely impact our industry . we will continue to work with leaders in our government to stop sequestration and find more thoughtful , balanced , and effective solutions to our nation ’ s challenges . <PARA> if sequestration were to happen , we are compelled to comply with the law and will do so as respectfully and as ably as we can . while we work to stop sequestration we will also continue to petition the government to outline exactly how sequestration will be implemented so that we can responsibly prepare for the impact to our employees and our business . <PARA> finally , as political reporter bob woodward noted , the sequester in the budget control act that could result in automatic defense spending cuts in 2013 was put there not as part of an obama administration policy to “ downsize the military ,” but as means of prodding congress into coming up with a concrete plan for addressing the deficit issue : <PARA> no one thought [ sequestration ] would happen . the idea was to design something ... that was so onerous that no one would ever let it happen . of course , it did , because [ congress ] couldn ’ t reach agreement . they all believed that the supercommittee was going to come up with a $ 1 . 2 trillion deficit -

1,"following the 2 december 2015 mass shooting in san bernardino , california , republican presidential candidate donald trump controversially suggested ( temporarily ) barring all muslims from entering the united <MASK> . during the ensuing debate over trump ’ s pronouncement , several web sites said that trump ’ s suggestion followed a precedent set by president jimmy carter barring iranian nationals from entering the u . s . during the iran hostage crisis of 1980 . <PARA> one such comparison was made in an 8 december 2015 frontpage mag <MASK> titled “ carter banned iranians from coming to us during hostage crisis : trump is just like hitler . or jimmy carter ,” which held that : <PARA> the <MASK> quickly spread online , primarily among people who favored trump ’ s proposed restrictions on muslim immigration . web sites spreading the <MASK> referenced a 7 april 1980 announcement by carter titled “ sanctions against iran remarks announcing u . s . actions ” and highlighted a portion of those remarks : <PARA> president carter had opted to impose sanctions on iran , which included a cessation of diplomatic relations , a prohibition on trade , assessment of previously - frozen iranian government assets , the cancellation of iranian - u . s . visas , and a moratorium on new visas ( with exceptions for humanitarian and otherwise compelling situations ) in response to iranian terrorists ’ having invaded the u . s . embassy in tehran five months earlier and taken 50 american citizens hostage : <PARA> stripped of context ( and if readers squinted very hard ), president carter ’ s remarks bore a passing resemblance to donald trump ’ s proposal . however , while carter ’ s action involved a well - defined class of persons ( iranian citizens ) being denied entry to the u . s . until a well - defined goal was achieved ( the hostages were released ), trump ’ s suggestion was ill - defined in scope and purpose : the latter advocated a “ total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united <MASK> ” ( which could apply to persons from any country in the world and would require making subjective estimations about their religious beliefs ) “ until our country ’ s representatives can figure out what is going on ” ( a vague and unintelligible goal ). <PARA> carter explicitly outlined the reasons behind the issuance of sanctions ( including visa cancellation for iranian nationals ) and underscored his intent to apply pressure to iran ’ s government release american hostages . by contrast , trump ’ s proposal was markedly different : not a sanction , but a security measure framed as a counterterrorism strategy , and one directed at all adherents of a particular religion ( regardless of their nationalities ) rather than citizens of a particular country . moreover , carter ’ s sanctions occurred during a lengthy period of escalating conflict between iran and the united <MASK> ( during which u . s . hostages remained in foreign captivity ), but trump ’ s proposal was issued in response to a mass shooting perpetrated by an american citizen and his immigrant wife . <PARA> carter ’ s sanctions were applied to iranian nationals as part of a clear objective to secure the release of the u . s . hostages without military intervention , whereas trump ’ s suggestion applied to a far broader cross - section of visa applicants , which he described as a measure to prevent terrorist attacks . historically , carter ’ s sanctions bore closer resemblance to kennedy administration - era sanctions on cuba [ pdf , pdf ] than trump ’ s anti - immigration plan .",2015-12-09T20:27:58+00:00,train_592,train,misinfo

( ibuprofen is also marketed under several other brand names , such as advil , medipren , and nuprin .) children ’ s motrin suspension first became available as a prescription product in 1989 , and in 1995 it was cleared by the food and drug administration for marketing as an over - the - counter product . both those landmarks occurred only after the product had been extensively tested on children : <PARA> robitussin pediatric cough is a syrup that contains dextromethorphan hbr , a cough suppressant . its pediatric cough & cold formulation contains chlorpheniramine maleate , an antihistamine , in addition to the dextromethorphan hbr . <PARA> we have not yet turned up any studies confirming heart attacks brought about by the combination of these two over - the - counter medications , either in children or adults , but that is not to say children should be taking otc cold medications . an 8 october 2008 <MASK> by the fda supports the recommendation of the consumer healthcare products association that children under the age of four should not be dosed with over - the - counter cough and cold products . this follows its january 2008 advisory that these products not be used in children under the age of 2 because of the risk of serious and potentially life - threatening side effects . <PARA> as noted in a news report from september 2007 : “ an fda review of side - effect records filed with the agency between 1969 and september 2006 found 54 reports of deaths in children associated with decongestant medicines made with pseudoephedrine , phenylephrine or ephedrine . it also found 69 reports of deaths associated with antihistamine medicines containing diphenhydramine , brompheniramine or chlorpheniramine . most of the deaths were children younger than 2 .” <PARA> the fda offers these medication tips to the parents and caregivers of small children : <PARA> in 2003 , another personal account circulated by e - mail implicated children ’ s motrin in the formation of stomach ulcers in a child dosed with it . we did not encounter any subsequent reports of similar instances , and no specific interaction precaution guidance exists for that drug combination . <PARA> <!– <PARA> variations : <PARA> on 22 december 2014 , children ’ s medical center of dallas addressed the recirculating <MASK> on twitter :",2009-02-11T16:44:00+00:00,test_1234,test,misinfo

1,"they are all round stickers , they are usually either as big as half dollar coins , or as small as nickels or pennies . they are either made out of a thin reflective plastic or the smaller ones i ’ ve seen are just plain paper . <PARA> now one of the odd and scary things i have heard about these stickers is that they have been placed there by people in working in secret for not just the government but for a up coming one world government . <PARA> and that the color of the stickers refer to the fate of each person when either the one world government or martial law gets established in our country . <PARA> the red indicates that they will come after you and kill you immediately , the blue means they will take you to a concentration camp or a “ fema camp ” and torture you until you either obey or die . <PARA> yellow means that they think you will mostly follow them or be no threat to them and they will just let you starve to death . <PARA> where as pink means you are totally in obedience to them and will basically be their mind slave . <PARA> now i personally am wondering if there is any truth to this . <PARA> <MASK> : a common form of <MASK> holds that homes are being marked in some subtle way — through the use of anything from cable ties to chalk marks to colored stickers to ribbons , placed on curbs , sidewalks , mailboxes , lampposts , or trees — by groups intent on targeting the residents for nefarious purposes — anyone from burglars to dog thieves to government agents — who will be returning later to implement their plans of stealing from ( or otherwise harming ) the people who live in those homes . in nearly every case such <MASK> prove to be <MASK> : the markings in question typically turn out to be innocuous indicators left behind by legitimate groups working in the area ( such as road crews , <PARA> utility companies , or surveyors ), and the <MASK> are started by suspicious residents unfamiliar with the purpose of the markings who immediately leap to the unfounded conclusion that they must have some connection to recent ( but purely coincidental ) criminal activity in the neighborhood . <PARA> all such <MASK> generally fail in their very premise . targeting homes for illicit purposes by marking them with some exterior symbol is unnecessarily inefficient : it requires time and effort to visit homes and mark them , it risks exposure from onlookers who might notice and call attention to the activity and discover its purpose , and the markings are too easily removed ( accidentally or purposely ) by residents or eradicated by weather , or overlooked by those supposed to be finding them afterwards . yet all of these vagaries can be easily avoided <MORE> , a sheeple , and you will be herded off to one of the many fema camps that are allegedly being set up all over the u . s . <PARA> if you have a yellow sticker , then you rock ! you are a strong supporter of socialism , the new world order , and the king , u . s . president barack hussein obama and you will be allowed to remain in your home — on house arrest . <PARA> those who believe this theory <MASK> that if you have a red sticker on your mail box , then fema has determined you to be a veteran , or a conservative , or a <MASK> patriot and that you are going to be killed on the first night that the new world order takes over . <PARA> if you have a blue sticker , then fema has determined that you believe many of the same things the people with red stickers believe , but you are a follower by nature , a sheeple , and you will be herded off to one of the many fema camps that are allegedly being set up all over the u . s . <PARA> if you have a yellow sticker , then you rock ! you are a strong supporter of socialism , the new world order , and the king , u . s . president barack hussein obama and you will be allowed to remain in your home — on house arrest . <PARA> if the mere premise of such a <MASK> weren ’ t enough in itself to discredit it ( surely any entity powerful enough to take control of the entire u . s . and lock up its citizens would have a better method for tracking the identities of its supporters and opponents than reflective stickers ), consider all the logistical problems it would entail , such as : <PARA> it is <MASK> ( as exemplified by the photograph displayed above ) that in some neighborhoods small , round reflective stickers of varying colors can be found on mailboxes , so what is their real purpose ? the answer can vary from area to area , but one common application is to help service workers who make their rounds in the darkness of nighttime or early morning hours to identify which homes belong to customers ( or non - customers ), and what level of service they are to receive . ( for example , such stickers might aid newspaper carriers in quickly finding subscribers ’ homes and identifying whether the residents receive daily , weekly , or sunday - only delivery .) such colored stickers have also been employed in the service of other ( non - illegal ) schemes , such as using them to distinguish mailboxes at homes that are vacant , have vacation holds , or house <PARA> postal customers who have indicated a desire not to receive junk mail .",2015-04-04T23:21:42+00:00,test_1249,test,misinfo

1,"in mid - october 2017 , conservative journalists and bloggers sought to link a case of child sexual abuse to an ongoing debate about allowing transgender people to use the public restroom that matches their gender . proponents of so - called “ bathroom bills ”, legislating that transgender people must use the restroom of the sex assigned to them at birth , have spuriously argued that transgender women ’ s use of women ’ s restrooms puts children in danger of sexual abuse . <PARA> the <MASK> was typically titled something like “ transgender wyoming woman convicted of sexually assaulting 10 - year - old girl in bathroom ,” and it was repeated by daily caller , daily wire , red flag news , silence is consent , fox news , and louder with crowder . the latter site <MASK> that the alleged assault was a direct consequence of bills allowing transgender people to use the bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity : <PARA> the post doesn ’ t cite any specific bills — likely because when people refer to “ bathroom bills ,” they generally mean bills proposed ( usually by republicans ) that prevent transgender people from using the restroom that corresponds to their gender . these laws have been considered by the legislature in 14 <MASK> in 2017 , including wyoming . <PARA> regardless , the october 2017 case bears little relation to the imagined scenario that opponents of transgender rights say is a risk — that of a “ man dressed as a woman ” abusing little girls in public bathrooms . <PARA> the person found guilty of this crime , michelle ( referred to as “ miguel ” in local news reports ) martinez , was not a stranger in a public restroom but rather a family friend who allegedly raped the 10 - year - old victim in a bathroom in the victim ’ s home . <PARA> as to martinez ’ s gender identity , the billings gazette reported of the case that : <PARA> aside from that brief mention , local news coverage consistently referred to the perpetrator as “ miguel martinez .” we contacted martinez ’ s lawyer dylan rosalez ( the case was transferred from hucke to rosalez , local reporter shane sanderson told us ), who confirmed that martinez identifies as a woman and goes by michelle . <PARA> martinez was also accused of beating her boyfriend with a metal broomstick in 2014 . <PARA> martinez pleaded not guilty and denies raping the girl . <PARA> while martinez is transgender and was convicted of raping a child , the case does not document that transgender persons are any more likely to sexually abuse minors than any other segment of the population . the idea that lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people are child abusers or pedophiles has long been used to foment prejudice , although those who push this idea have often been hard - pressed to provide any <MASK> for that <MASK> . <PARA> the sad fact is children are far more likely to be abused or raped by someone that they know than by a stranger . the rape , abuse and incest national network estimates that in 93 percent of sexual abuse cases reported to law enforcement , the victim knows their abuser .",2017-10-20T17:33:57+00:00,train_8023,train,misinfo

1,"the most common form taken by the “ vanishing hitchhiker ” legend involves a driver who stops to pick up a strange girl on a highway , then during the course of the ride realizes his guest has disappeared . upon arriving at the address she had mentioned , the driver learns from her relatives that the woman who ’ d ridden with him has been dead for years . <PARA> however , that legend also exists in a secondary version which similarly features a hitchhiker who dematerializes from a moving car , but only after solemnly intoning a prophecy . good crops , the end of a war , a natural catastrophe about to strike , or the imminent coming of jesus have been predicted by these vanishing prophets . common to many of these tales is the completing element of the baffled and somewhat unsettled driver ’ s reporting the incident to police or other authorities , only to be told he ’ s the fourth or fifth person that week to have announced having had such an encounter . that element is a plot device necessary to the believability of the <MASK> : without the confirmation from an authority figure that others have shared the same experience , those being regaled with the yarn could quietly conclude the person who heard the prophecy and witnessed its deliverer vanish from the car was off his rocker . <PARA> while in the spring of 2009 we noted an uptick in the number of reportings of the heavenly messenger version of the “ vanishing hitchhiker ” legend , the narrative itself is as old as the hills . modern tellings of the tale have the incident happening “ in lexington ( kentucky )” or “ near warsaw , indiana ” or “ a week or so ago ,” but other versions of this yarn have been kicking around since the 1940s , and precursors to it appear in the bible . <PARA> vanishing prophets who predict catastrophes or speak of the coming of christ or the end of the world are often said to look like jesus , or indeed to have straight - out said they were jesus . ( the latter is a popular element in versions collected in the spring of 1971 and winter of 1972 , periods coinciding with religious revival on american campuses .) alternatively , they are also often said to have done something indicating they were angels ( e . g ., saying “ my lips are near the trumpet ,” a <MASK> meant to identify its speaker as the archangel gabriel ). this form of the legend often surfaces in the wake of a natural disaster , with the encounter said to have happened maybe all of a week before things went to hell in a handbasket . <PARA> the vanishing prophet set of stories contains a smaller subset in which the prediction of one future event is bolstered by the prediction of a second , equally unbelievable event which subsequently comes <MASK> : <PARA> simpler forms of the legend omit the “ man dies in the car , thereby making one outlandish prediction come <MASK> and consequently adding credibility to the second , as yet unrealized , foretelling ” and skip straight to the prophecy the heavenly messenger has been sent to deliver : <PARA> while “ jesus is coming ” or “ the end of the world is near ” messages are the most common ones imparted in prevalent recountings of this tale , at other times in <MASK> tidings of a different sort have been the legend ’ s focus — such as conclusion of a war the nation is currently embroiled in , the death of a national enemy , assurances about the harvest , or even pronouncements of pestilence to come . <PARA> as to how old these sorts of stories are , says folklorist gail de vos about the antecedents to the “ heavenly messenger vanishing hitchhiker ” legend : <PARA> as to why this legend endures generation after generation and is told in various countries around the globe , difficult times spawn anxieties that as bad as things are , they are about to get worse . resurgence of tales about heavenly messengers sent to alert the world that the end is near are expressions of the underlying current of dread that makes itself felt during periods of unease or upheaval . such legends are also confirmatory tales of religious belief , in that they offer the comfort that all is unfolding as part of god ’ s greater plan . <PARA> previous generations ( some might say stretching back to the very beginnings of recorded time ) have had their doomsday predictors , yet the world is still here , having weathered innumerable dark eras of pestilence , war , and economic upheaval . such predictions tend to become fewer ( or at least get roundly pooh - poohed ) when people feel less anxious about their futures .",2009-05-02T17:41:24+00:00,train_6663,train,misinfo

1,"although milk has long been a staple of the american diet , a century ago many people did not have access to fresh milk . <PARA> because of the comparatively primitive <MASK> of the transportation and refrigeration industries back then , milk — a highly perishable food item — could not generally be transported over long distances efficiently , and therefore those who did not live sufficiently close to a dairy supply source ( or keep their own cows ) could not count on having regular access to safe , unspoiled milk . <PARA> the solution to this marketing roadblock was the development of evaporated milk , a product created through a process which greatly reduced the volume of whole milk by removing about 60 % of its water content via evaporation and ensured it remained fit for consumption much longer than fresh milk by subjecting it to heat - treatment sterilization and sealing it into cans . the finished product could be transported over long distances much more easily than whole milk because it was considerably reduced in volume and weight and did not require refrigeration . by adding water to the contents of a can of evaporated milk , consumers could obtain a reasonable substitute for fresh , whole milk and be assured that the product was sanitary . <PARA> ( although the terms “ evaporated milk ” and “ condensed milk ” are often used interchangeably , the latter term can refer to either of two very different products . evaporated milk and unsweetened condensed milk are both products made by removing approximately 60 % of the water from whole milk and sterilizing the remainder through heat - treatment . sweetened condensed milk is produced by adding a good deal of sugar to milk prior to removing 60 % of its water , producing a sticky , sweet mixture which does not need to be heat - sterilized [ because the added sugar acts as a natural preservative ] and which cannot be turned back into a drink similar to whole milk through the addition of water .) <PARA> one of the pioneers of the evaporated milk business was a grocer from kent , washington , named elbridge amos stuart , who in 1899 co - founded the pacific coast condensed milk company , selling canned evaporated milk to prospectors heading north to the yukon gold rush . stuart ’ s faith in the general marketability of evaporated milk was well - founded , and , as sales began to grow , legend has it that he stumbled across the now - famous name for his product while strolling through downtown seattle . spotting a display of “ carnation ” cigars in a tobacconist ’ s window , stuart thought the brand name an odd one for a stogie but a good one for his own product , and thus began the association of canned evaporated milk with a red - and - white label bearing the <MORE> , and he maintained the firm belief that a steady supply of good - quality milk could be ensured only by obtaining it from healthy cows . to that end he furnished his suppliers with purebred bulls to help them breed better milk cows , and he eventually established his own breeding farm , known as carnation farm . stuart ’ s philosophy of “ contented cows give better milk ” is reflected in this ad copy from a 1909 carnation milk newspaper advertisement : <PARA> evaporated milk soon became , as its founder had envisioned , as much a staple of grocery store shelves as salt or sugar . although carnation was far from the only brand of evaporated milk available ( borden ’ s eagle was a strong competitor ), it has long been the market leader and best - known national brand of evaporated milk in america , and generations of americans raised on it fondly recall the familiar sight of red - and - white carnation cans in their kitchen cupboards . by the time it was bought up by nestlé s . a . in 1985 , the carnation company had grown from a producer of evaporated milk to a multi - billion - dollar conglomerate offering over 200 products , including market - leading brands in everything from tomato paste ( contadina ) to pet food ( friskies ). <PARA> such was the fame and ubiquity of carnation evaporated milk in america that it became the subject of an affection expressed through humorous , satirical rhymes . just a schoolkids of my own era ( the 1960s ) spun nonsensical riffs on popular songs , television theme music , and commercial jingles , so those of an earlier time delighted in inventing and repeating variations on a bawdy bit of verse about a familiar household product : <PARA> although catchy rhymes and consumer participation contests are methods which have been used by a number of companies over the years to promote their products ( see our burma - shave page for a prime example ), carnation did not sponsor a contest inviting consumers to complete a rhyme beginning with the line “ carnation milk is best of all ...” which prompted the submission of the “ just poke a hole ” verse by a “ little lady from north carolina ” who mailed it to carnation and was rewarded with a $ 1 , 000 prize for her efforts . this piece is just a funny bit of doggerel fashioned about a common household product by a variety of anonymous jokesters decades ago which has since been dressed up with a framework presenting it as “ <MASK> <MASK> ” in a fashion similar to many other jokes - turned - urban - legend . <PARA> printed references to this verse indicate that it might be almost a century old itself . for example , the following presentation appears in a college literature textbook :",2003-09-10T15:46:08+00:00,train_3079,train,misinfo

1,"the stamp described in the example section above exists , although it is not new , it is not a “ christmas stamp ,” and it has nothing to do with president barack obama . <PARA> the eid stamp was a 2001 usps holiday series stamp commemorating two islamic holidays that have no connection to christmas . it was introduced by the united <MASK> postal service ( at the then - current 34 - cent rate ) as part of its holiday celebrations series on 1 september 2001 , just ten days before the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . it has since been reissued ( with varying background colors ) at updated first - class postage rates in 2002 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , and as a forever stamp after 2011 . <PARA> as the usps describes the eid stamp : <PARA> the word “ eid ” is roughly equivalent to the english word “ celebration ” or “ festival .” the three - day eid al - fitr celebrates the end of the month - long fasting of ramadan ; the three - day eid al - adha commemorates the willingness of the prophet abraham to sacrifice his son ishmael in response to god ’ s command *, and it marks the end of hajj , the annual muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca . ( in 2016 , eid al - fitr begins at sundown on july 6 , and eid al - adha commences at sundown on september 12 .) <PARA> the eid commemorative is often mischaracterized as a “ christmas stamp ,” but it has nothing to do with christmas other than that it is part of a series of u . s . postage stamps commemorating several diverse celebrations , some of which generally occur around the november - december “ holiday season ” timeframe ( christmas , hanukkah , kwanzaa , thanksgiving ), some of which occur at other times of year ( cinco de mayo ), and some of which move around from year to year relative to the gregorian calendar ( eid al - fitr and eid al - adha ). <PARA> the <MASK> “[ muslims ] don ’ t even believe in christ and they ’ re getting their own christmas stamp !” is therefore nonsensical , akin to protesting hanukkah stamps because “ jews don ’ t even believe in christ but they have their own christmas stamp !” ( although muslims do not believe that jesus was the son of god , islam does regard him as a prophet , a mortal who was divinely chosen to spread god ’ s message .) <PARA> an august 2009 version of the “ muslim stamp ” e - mail added the <MASK> that “ president obama has directed the united <MASK> postal service to remember and honor the eid muslim holiday season with a new commemorative 42 cent first class holiday postage stamp .” this <MASK> is manifestly <MASK> : the eid stamp was introduced in 2001 , eight years before barack obama became president of the united <MASK> , and usps stamp designs are chosen by the citizens ’ stamp advisory committee ( csac ) and not by u . s . presidents . <PARA> the issue of “ boycotting ” a stamp that commemorates islamic holidays is largely moot , since eid stamps are generally a specialty item sold mostly to postal customers who specifically request them . moreover , the eid stamp is an ordinary first - class postage stamp ; all proceeds from its sale go to the usps , not to any muslim - related groups or organizations . <PARA> the eid stamp is also not the first or only governmental or commercial recognition of these islamic holidays in the u . s . the american greeting card manufacturer hallmark has produced a variety of holiday cards celebrating eid al - fitr , and president obama ’ s predecessor in the white house , president george w . bush , extended official greetings , issued messages , participated in commemorations of both eid al - fitr and eid al - adha ( even after the september 11 attacks ), and promoted the eid stamp via the white house web site . <PARA> variations : the following images have been circulated as pictures of the usps “ muslim ” stamp ( or as an “ arabic valentine ’ s day stamp ”), but neither depicts the eid stamp : the former is a non - usps custom stamp ordered through the zazzle web site , and the latter is one of the usps ’ s 2013 kaleidoscope flowers series : <PARA> (* this is the reverse of judeo - christian tradition , which holds that abraham was commanded by god to sacrifice not ishmael but his other son , isaac .)",2013-10-04T05:50:56+00:00,train_353,train,misinfo
1,"the 1924 democratic national convention , which lasted an unheard - of 16 days and required 103 ballots for delegates to agree on a nominee , holds the record as the longest continuously - running presidential nominating convention in united <MASK> <MASK> . <PARA> it was also one of the most controversial . the democratic party was deeply divided , with one of its two main candidates — new york ’ s irish catholic governor alfred e . smith — representing the so - called “ urban ” faction of the party and the other , former u . s . treasury secretary william mcadoo , representing rural interests . mcadoo ’ s constituency was anti - league of nations , pro - prohibition , anti - immigrant , and pro - ku klux klan . smith ’ s was the opposite . <PARA> attesting to the growing influence of the kkk in american politics at the time , a platform plank favored by smith supporters that would have condemned the klan by name went down to defeat after a raucous debate that degenerated into fisticuffs . on the 103rd ballot , the delegates finally nominated a dark - horse candidate named john w . davis , who , in contrast to his gop counterpart , calvin coolidge , would take a strong stand against the kkk during the presidential campaign . coolidge won the election by a landslide . <PARA> despite the fact that the klan had sunk its tendrils just as deeply into republican party politics ( an anti - kkk platform plank similar to the one rejected by democrats met the same fate at that year ’ s republican convention ), the extent of the group ’ s supposed control over the 1924 democratic convention has come to be exaggerated to legendary proportions . that is in large part thanks to the efforts of social media propagandists bent on tarring democrats in particular with the legacy of the klan ’ s religious bigotry , xenophobia , and racism . <PARA> the internet is rife with memes asserting , for example , that the kkk put on a show of power by holding a massive march and rally at the convention , which supposedly became known , for that reason , as “ the klanbake ”: <PARA> according to a blog post replicated on a number of right -

( his portrayal of <PARA> barney fife eventually won him five consecutive emmy awards for best supporting actor in a television series .) don knotts also had one other military connection of the cinematic variety : he played the character of corporal john c . brown in stage and film versions of no time for sergeants . <PARA> why so many <MASK> about entertainers as military figures ? the prevalence of this legend type can probably be attributed to the appeal of imagining popular stars as the polar opposites of their on - stage personas : just as we ’ re intrigued by the notion that macabre rocker marilyn manson once portrayed the geeky paul pfeiffer character on tv ’ s the wonder years , so we ’ re fascinated with the notion that a slight , skinny man best known for playing a series of fumbling , high - strung , nervous characters was once one of world war ii ’ s “ most feared drill instructors .” legends like these confirm the belief that we never know what improbable paths life might lead us down and that appearances can be deceiving .",2015-04-03T22:44:34+00:00,test_312,test,misinfo

sex couples have come forward with accounts of the difficulties they encountered when trying to obtain citizenship for their foreign - born children thanks to a u . s . <MASK> department policy on the use of assisted reproductive technology ( i . e ., egg donors , <MASK> surrogates , and the like ). <PARA> a 15 may 2019 <MASK> in the daily beast cited two cases detailing the effects the policy has had on lgbt families . roee and adiel kiviti , a gay couple who were legally married and u . s . citizens , were told by officials that their daughter , who was born in canada via an egg donor and surrogate mother , was ineligible for acquired citizenship because she was born “ out of wedlock ” ( as defined by the <MASK> department ). a similar rationale was used to deny a passport to the child of a lesbian couple — again legally married , though one partner was a u . s . citizen and the other was not — whose sons were both born in england . because one of their sons wasn ’ t genetically related to his u . s . citizen mother ( his birth mother was italian ), he was officially deemed born “ out of wedlock ” and not a u . s . citizen . their other son , born to the mother who was a u . s . citizen , acquired citizenship without difficulty . <PARA> the relevant policy , versions of which have been in place since at least the mid - 2000s , can be found in the current edition of the <MASK> department ’ s foreign affairs manual . it revised existing immigration and nationality act ( ina ) guidelines for assessing whether a child is biologically related to a parent , and whether the child was born in or out of wedlock , in cases where assisted reproductive technology ( art ) was used . the practical effect of the policy has been to throw up extra roadblocks to u . s . citizenship for the children conceived and born via art . <PARA> even though the ina provides that some children born out of wedlock on foreign soil can acquire citizenship through their citizen parent ( s ), these families face stiffer residency requirements , more paperwork , and closer scrutiny by authorities , up to and including dna tests to prove biological parenthood <MORE> on american families .” <PARA> “ once again ,” pelosi wrote , “ the trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda by denying citizenship to children born abroad to same - sex american couples , as well as those who seek medical treatment overseas in order to conceive .” <PARA> but while it ’ s <MASK> that the trump administration is responsible for enforcing it , any blame laid on the current administration for the policy ’ s existence is misplaced . as noted above , the art rules have been in place since at least the mid - 2000s , and requirements pertaining to biological parentage have existed since the 1990s . the policy was liberalized somewhat during the obama administration ( in 2014 ) to confer birthright citizenship on children born to u . s . citizen mothers using in vitro fertilization with donor eggs ( an archived copy of the policy as it appeared in 2015 is available here ). news <MASK> have noted that the policy was revised again in 2018 , two years after trump was elected , but a <MASK> department official told us that that update was “ non - substantive ” and that the relevant regulations have remained unchanged for several years . <PARA> nor was the trump administration the first to enforce the policy . prior to its 2014 reinterpretation of the rule pertaining to conception via donor eggs , for example , the obama administration denied citizenship to the children of their <MASK> mother , u . s . citizen ellie lavi , on precisely that basis . <PARA> in an interview with public radio international , allison blixt , one of the lesbian mothers mentioned above who were told that their children were technically born “ out of wedlock ” ( even though she and her wife are married ), said that their troubles with the <MASK> department began during the obama administration : <PARA> “ it was already affecting us before trump ,” she said . “ as much as we want to point to his administration , in fact it was happening already . and when we filed our lawsuit , we hoped that the government would see the error of its ways at least at that point ... and that they would change the policy . in conversations it seemed like they were going to try and change the policy . but i have a feeling it got up higher in the chain and they decided not to .” <PARA> in summary , it ’ s accurate to say that the trump administration is denying citizenship to some children born abroad to same -

( red dye # 2 has been banned by the fda since 1976 .) for whatever reason , many folks have come to suspect the color additive in hummingbird nectar poses a danger to the little creatures , with the “ it thins the shells of their eggs ” belief heard most often as the specific harm wrought by the coloring . others reasons <MASK> for avoiding red dye include a fear the substance will build up in hummingbirds ’ kidneys or livers , or that new hatchlings whose mothers partook of the sweet will be born blind or deformed . <PARA> the red dye traditionally added to attract hummers to nectar dispensers may never have been necessary anyway . while it is <MASK> hummingbirds are drawn to red , there is more than one way to entice a bird . <PARA> according to an entry found in the audubon society ’ s faq : <PARA> the audubon society ’ s page does not detail the harm it fears dye could potentially cause . we ’ re unaware of any definitive study either linking the colorant to a particular illness in hummingbirds or demonstrating it to be harmless . anecdotal <MASK> postulates a causal connection with beak and liver tumors . <PARA> rather than take a chance with the little birds ’ health , many bird fanciers have chosen to omit red dye from the liquid feed they offer their airborne visitors . a mixture of 1 cup of sugar to 4 cups of water makes a perfectly serviceable nectar . ( do not use honey in place of sugar , because it can promote the growth of a fungus that kills hummers .) dye is unnecessary in the mix because the birds are already attracted to the red coloring of the feeders themselves . but do keep those feeders clean , because the sugar / water mix can ferment fairly quickly in the summer sun , making it bad for the very wildlife it ’ s meant to energize . <PARA> the feeding of hummingbirds has attracted a second <MASK> , one of a more sinister nature : <PARA> we haven ’ t found a news account or other report of any such incident . moreover , hummingbirds generally draw their sustenance from spiders , flies , gnats , and other insects they eat , not from the sweet nectar they sip . the sugary liquid provides extra energy to the birds , but it ’ s not their primary source of nutrition . <PARA> some bird lovers fear the presence of their nectar dispensers will tempt the little birds to delay migration , causing coddled hummers to become trapped by the sudden onset of cold weather . yet they need not so fearful , because the hummingbird ’ s instinct to migrate is too strong to be sidetracked . when it ’ s time to go , they know .",2003-09-12T08:01:01+00:00,train_2338,train,misinfo

1,"on june 10 , 2020 — one day after the funeral of george floyd , a black man who died in the custody of minneapolis police and sparked a national reckoning over racism and police brutality — floyd ’ s younger brother , philonise floyd , testified before the u . s . house judiciary committee . in the roughly five - minute speech , he described his sibling ’ s death as one in a series of senseless killings of black men by american cops and asked the committee to “ stop the pain ” for families like his . <PARA> “ people of all backgrounds , genders and races have come together to demand change — honor them , honor george , and make the necessary changes that make law enforcement the solution and not the problem ,” he testified . “ the people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough .” <PARA> hours after the testimony , u . s . house speaker nancy pelosi , who is not a member of the committee , tweeted the below - displayed post to publicize his participation in the hearing and to apparently show her followers that she supported him . <PARA> the tweet quickly drew criticism online among supporters of u . s . president donald trump , veterans , and their families who alleged the tweet and its photos showed pelosi inappropriately giving a folded american flag in a presentation case to philonise floyd ; they <MASK> such a gesture was reserved only for the relatives of members of the u . s . armed forces or police officers after they die . “ what a slap in the face to service members ,” one person tweeted . <PARA> peggy hubbard , who is a retired navy veteran , former police officer , and republican candidate in illinois ’ 2020 senate race , added to the criticism with a viral facebook video in which she made vague references to a group of people who have disrespected the flag ( presumably during protests against police brutality in the wake of george floyd ’ s death ) and <MASK> democrats had committed an offense by giving philonise floyd a folded american flag that is “ preserved for veterans .” she said : <PARA> readers asked snopes to investigate the <MASK> about the folded flag — many of whom asked whether the photograph with pelosi was “ real ” or digitally manipulated in any way — and we found the assertion contains some truth and some <MASK> . <PARA> firstly , we considered procedures by the u . s . department of veterans affairs ( va ), which gifts american flags during funeral services to the relatives of the deceased who fit the below - displayed categories ( as outlined on the va ’ s website ) and who make the request . <PARA> floyd did not qualify for such a ceremony . he was born in <MORE> a set of federal advisories for how people should display and care for the american flag ? <PARA> for the former , we analyzed the account from where the tweet <MASK> . with more than 4 . 8 million followers , it is the verified account for which pelosi promotes her public appearances , media interviews , and political agenda , and it is linked with her official website as u . s . house speaker . <PARA> the tweet on june 10 , 2020 , was posted roughly one hour after pelosi called for the removal of 11 <MASK> representing confederate leaders and about 30 minutes before the twitter account circulated an interview pelosi gave to cnn . and in that footage , pelosi is wearing what appeared to be the same outfit ( a blue shirt , off - white blazer with a lapel gold pin , and blue mask ) she wore when photographed giving the alleged folded american flag to philonise floyd . <PARA> to explore whether pelosi had broken federal guidelines for how to handle the flag , we reviewed title 4 and title 36 of u . s . code , which designates “ the star - spangled banner ” as the national anthem and advises how americans should treat the flag . among other things , the <MASK> <MASK> : “ no disrespect should be shown to the flag of the united <MASK> of america .” <PARA> here ’ s what ’ s key in the analysis : no language in the federal <MASK> prohibits government officials — or anyone — from presenting a folded flag to any american for any reason . also , the <MASK> do not prescribe symbolic meaning to the 13 steps people traditionally use to fold a flag into a triangle , like the one philonise floyd received .

5g conspiracy websites and social media pages . <PARA> kuhles , who recently suggested that the <MASK> november 2018 california wildfires were triggered by a direct energy weapon as an act of revenge from the “ ruling elite ” to punish the <MASK> for vetoing a “ mass 5g deployment ” plan , tied the factual existence of unexplained bird deaths at a park ( huijgenspark ) in the hague , netherlands , to a non - existent test of a next generation cell phone network ( 5g ) that kuhles <MASK> ( without <MASK> ) took place simultaneous with the bird deaths : <PARA> it is <MASK> a series of mysterious bird deaths has occurred at a park in the hague . according to the municipal government , the birds began to die on 19 october 2018 , and soon afterwards those deaths inspired a dog ban in huijgenspark as a precautionary measure : <PARA> testing performed by the netherlands food and consumer product safety authority ruled out west nile virus and the usutu virus , but it had not yet ruled out other viruses or poisoning as of 12 november 2018 . a team of experts will continue to investigate the cause of these deaths : <PARA> mysterious bird deaths , though great fodder for conspiracy cranks , are not uncommon . due to their unexplained nature , they are popular with those seeking to stoke fears or make political or religious points . in 2011 , for example , arkansas , louisiana , and parts of sweden were the site of thousands of bird deaths in a short time , which the media dubbed “ the aflockalypse .” contemporaneous reporting by the associated press made it clear that these mass die - offs are quite common and often unexplained : <PARA> 5g is the proposed 5th generation cellular network , and it is technology that is largely still in development . various countries have tested forms of it , including the netherlands , but its widespread adoption is not expected until 2020 . we will discuss the technical aspects of 5g compared to existing cellular technology in the next section , but widespread access to this technology is a priority for the dutch government , and they have performed tests of the technology a handful of times . <PARA> one such test did occur in an area generally near huijgenspark , but it took place on 28 june 2018 , and it was not followed by a massive bird die - off . <MORE> coverage layer ,” a 3 . 4 - 3 . 8ghz band which will be the primary bandwidth , and a “ super data layer ” in the higher frequency 24 . 25 - 27 . 5ghz band . this latter range is more theoretical and is not what has been tested in the netherlands thus far , as the only known test of 5g in the hague utilized the 3 . 4 - 3 . 8ghz band . regardless , all of these frequencies fall within a range considered by the international commission on non - ionizing radiation protection ( first in 1998 and again in 2009 ) to be safe : <PARA> radio waves used in cellular technology can be described both by their frequency ( or wavelength ) and in terms of the energy being used to carry that frequency . the aforementioned restrictions refer to limits on the energy carrying a signal , which create exposure limits for various frequencies . dr . eric van rongen , a member of the health council of the netherlands and the chairman of the international commission on non - ionizing radiation protection , told us via email that the levels of exposure in the 5g frequency range are comparable to existing technology : <PARA> “ even if there would have been 5g exposure ,” he told us , it is “ very unlikely that that could cause the [ bird ] mortality .” <PARA> one of the great benefits to being a conspiracy blogger , outside of the fact that copy and pasting a facebook post counts as “ reporting ” and that objective reality need not be considered , is that you don ’ t really need to follow up or correct yourself even when the person pushing a given conspiracy completely changes his tune . erin elizabeth ’ s post , which has been shared well over 125 , 000 times on facebook , included all of khule ’ s posts on the subject up to 2 november 2018 . <PARA> but on 8 november 2018 , kuhles posted again , appealing to his own authority while making sure everyone knew he wasn ’ t really all that serious about that whole 5g thing in the first place . he brushed off factual criticism by calling his doubters sheeple and capitalizing certain words to make the letters lie more prominent : <PARA> as compelling as this kind of testimony may be to erin elizabeth ’ s health nut news , the facts are this : no 5g test occurred during the time that the mysterious starling deaths occurred , and the only person suggesting otherwise is someone with a vendetta against both objective reality and 5g wireless . even if a 5g test had occurred , however , no mechanism exists that would explain how it could have affected starlings at all , let alone only starlings and no other birds or animals in the region .",2018-11-13T22:39:18+00:00,train_3110,train,misinfo

( the obama version <MASK> above is a rare exception to that pattern , in that the ex - boyfriend is positioned as the owner of a restaurant , albeit one that “ wasn ’ t too luxurious .”) <PARA> while the earliest obama versions of this tale appear to date to late 2010 , the <MASK> itself has been around much longer , and has been applied to numerous u . s . presidents and their wives over the years . <PARA> bill and hillary clinton versions have been noted as far back as 1993 . this version was posted online in march 2002 : <PARA> a telling hillary clinton joke has the then - first lady and the president driving along in scenic arkansas . when they pull over for gas , clinton notices his wife has jumped out of the car , bounded over to the gas - <MASK> attendant , thrown her arms around him , and kissed him with tears of joy . “ who was that ?” a bemused bill asks as they drive away . “ oh ,” replies hillary somewhat wistfully , “ he was an old flame i haven ’ t seen in years .” “ well ,” says slick willie with a smirk , “ i guess if you hadn ’ t married me , you ’ <MORE> early forties stopped at a service <MASK> to refuel their luxury sedan . it had been a long drive , and they both got out of the car to stretch their legs . the service attendant was startled when he thought he recognized the woman . he enthusiastically asked , “ connie , is that you ?” she turned and remembered him as her high school boyfriend . they joined hands and laughed with fond memories . she then introduced her husband , bob , who was shocked to see this display of affection . as they were driving back onto the highway , he asked , “ just who was that guy that you were so glad to see ?” <PARA> connie explained the he was her first real boyfriend from high school . she confessed that he was more serious about the relationship than she was . bob then sarcastically said , “ it ’ s a good thing you didn ’ t marry him . you would have been stuck with a greasy car mechanic .” she was not amused . she then said , “ if i had married him , he would have become president of the bank instead of you .” <PARA> connie explained the he was her first real boyfriend from high school . she confessed that he was more serious about the relationship than she was . bob then sarcastically said , “ it ’ s a good thing you didn ’ t marry him . you would have been stuck with a greasy car mechanic .” she was not amused . she then said , “ if i had married him , he would have become president of the bank instead of you .” <PARA> in all its tellings , the legend conveys the belief that even men lauded for having achieved dizzying levels of success are in fact rather ordinary lads who would not have climbed nearly so high had they not yoked themselves to exceptional women . had they married differently , their success would have been some lucky other fellow ’ s lot , says the tale . <PARA> while at first blush , the <MASK> seems to confirm that it ’ s the wife who is the making of the one she marries rather than the husband who daily toils in pursuit of his advancement , at a deeper level it tends to confirm a popular conceit that the sole proper occupation for an ambitious woman is that of working behind the scenes to ensure her spouse ’ s success . she ’ s not the one who is to labor towards becoming president or a bank manager or the ceo of a thriving company ; her job is instead to guide the man she weds to those heights , her duly assigned place to be standing adoringly and silently at his side when the laurels are being tossed . <PARA> barbara “ help meat ” mikkelson",2011-04-18T15:53:52+00:00,train_5087,train,misinfo

0,"in july 2016 , a gold miner in the klondike goldfields of the canadian yukon who was thawing frozen ground and mud to locate placer deposits came upon a much furrier , historically valuable discovery . locked in the permafrost were the perfectly preserved remains of a wolf pup that had died an estimated 57 , 000 years ago . and in december 2020 , researchers at des moines university characterized the world ’ s “ most complete ” wolf mummy in the scientific journal , current biology . <PARA> now named zhùr , which means “ wolf ” in the local language of the tr ’ ondëk hwëch people , the pup is believed to be a pleistocene gray wolf who died at the age of about seven weeks . zhùr was so well preserved at the time of her death that her skin , fur , and the papillae on her lips are all still visible . <PARA> “ she ’ s the most complete wolf mummy that ’ s ever been found . she ’ s basically 100 % intact — all that ’ s missing are her eyes ,” said study author julie meachen , an associate professor of anatomy at des moines university in a news release . “ and the fact that she ’ s so complete allowed us to do so many lines of inquiry on her to basically reconstruct her life .” <PARA> zhùr measured just 14 inches long and weighed under 1 . 5 pounds . morphometric , isotopic , and genetic analyses of the pup provided details of her appearance and evolutionary relationship to wolves — all of which contributed to understanding how the young canine died . <PARA> “ it ’ s rare to find these mummies in the yukon . the animal has to die in a permafrost location , where the ground is frozen all the time , and they have to get buried very quickly , like any other fossilization process ,” said meachen . “ if it lays out on the frozen tundra too long it ’ ll decompose or get eaten .” <PARA> but how did zhùr die ? to find out , meachen and her team first needed to determine how the pup lived . <PARA> as a mammal ages , its bones fuse together , helping researchers to determine an animal ’ s age . radiographs of the canine ’ s skeleton showed that the epiphyses and epiphyseal plates ( also known as the “ growth plates ”) located at the end of long bones had partially fused . by comparing it to the growth rate of a domestic dog , the researchers were able to determine that zhùr was just under two months when she died . based on the birthing cycle of modern wolves , it ’ s likely that her den collapsed in july or early august . <PARA> in order to determine when zhùr died , researchers turned to radiocarbon dating , a method that analyzes the level of three carbon isotopes in an organic item — like a wolf mummy — and compares it to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere through geological <MASK> . in short , a mummy ’ s level of carbon isotopes will by and large match carbon in the atmosphere at the time of death . an analysis of zhùr ’ s dna from hair follicles and oxygen isotopes from tooth enamel suggests that she lived and died between 56 , 000 and 57 , 000 years ago . <PARA> her dna suggests that zhùr likely descended from ancient gray wolves in russia , siberia , and alaska . this evolutionary group , or clade , also includes individuals from eurasia and north america , a finding that provides further <MASK> to suggest that the continents were connected during the pleistocene epoch by way of a giant swath of ice known as the bering land bridge . but because zhùr ’ s dna does not prove she is a direct ancestor of gray wolves in canada today , it is thought that wolves in the area experienced at least one wave of regional extinction before being replaced by another subgroup . <PARA> understanding zhùr ’ s relationship to modern - day wolves helps to paint a bigger picture of her time on earth . using that information , the researchers analyzed her diet and determined it was heavily influenced by how closely she lived to the water . her diet largely consisted of aquatic resources , particularly salmon . this particular area of the klondike river where she was found is a spawning ground for king salmon and a feeding area for wolves of today . <PARA> because the pup had a mouth full of teeth and was otherwise healthy at the time of her death , in addition to her high level of preservation , the scientists concluded that she likely died instantly when her den collapsed . but the discovery also presented as many questions as it did insights . why was zhùr the only wolf found in the den ? what happened to her parents or siblings ? could it have been that she was an only pup , or was she the only one present when the den collapsed ? <PARA> answers to these questions may never be found , but viewing zhùr has been made possible by the tr ’ ondëk hwëch ’ in people , who placed the pup on display in december 2020 at the yukon beringia interpretive center in whitehorse , the capital city of yukon .",2020-12-24 18:34:59+00:00,test_1273,test,info

1,"<MASK> : in 1878 , managers at procter & gamble ’ s soap and candle factory in cincinnati , ohio , were puzzled by consumer requests for more of “ the soap that floats .” the company had recently introduced a new product called white soap , an offering meant to compete with the fine soaps from spain that were then taking a fair bite out of the american market . could white soap be the mysterious “ soap that floats ” consumers kept inquiring about ? <PARA> the <MASK> that procter & gamble had always offered was that the “ floating soap ” was the result of an accident : <PARA> perhaps ivory ’ s most famous feature — its ability to float — was the result of an accident ! an employee failed to shut off the soap - making machine when he went to lunch . when he returned , he found the soap mixture puffed - up and frothy . after consulting with his supervisor , the decision was made to finish and ship the soap since the ingredients had not been changed in any way by the longer mixing time . <PARA> about a month later , p & g received orders for more of “ the floating soap .” the people in the order department were perplexed . only after some detective work was the mystery solved . the long forgotten lunch - time accident had produced a floating soap ! <PARA> about a month later , p & g received orders for more of “ the floating soap .” the people in the order department were perplexed . only after some detective work was the mystery solved . the long forgotten lunch - time accident had produced a floating soap ! <PARA> because of this employee ’ s supposed error , far more than the usual amount of air was incorporated into that one particular batch . rather than confess to his screw - up , he sent the overwhipped product down the line . the batch hardened , was chopped into bars , and was sent on to market with no one other than the one errant worker ( and possibly his manager ) knowing anything was out of place about it . <PARA> in 2004 , however , a procter & gamble company archivist found information documenting that the “ floating soap ” came about through deliberation , not accident : <PARA> company archivist ed rider said he has discovered that a p & g chemist , james n . gamble , had previously studied with another chemist who already knew how to make soap float . gamble was son of company co - founder james gamble . <PARA> rider said he has discovered a notebook entry from 1863 in which gamble wrote : “ i made floating soap today . i think we ’ ll make all of our stock that way .” <PARA> the company ’ s early leadership realized that the floating capacity could have marketing appeal , rider said . <PARA> rider said he has discovered a notebook entry from 1863 in which gamble wrote : “ i made floating soap today . i think we ’ ll make all of our stock that way .” <PARA> the company ’ s early leadership realized that the floating capacity could have marketing appeal , rider said . <PARA> whatever its <MASK> , consumers loved this exciting new product because they were no longer fishing about in murky water for elusive soap . the new white soap refused to get lost , as it would pop up to the surface no matter how many times it was dropped into a bucket or sink . procter & gamble was quick to see the advantages of marketing such a product . orders were given to henceforth produce all batches of white soap as “ floating soap ” to meet consumer demand , and in october 1879 the first bar of ivory soap was produced : <PARA> today , ivory floats because we intentionally whip a small amount of air into ivory as it ’ s being made . this makes the soap lighter than water , so it floats . this process also makes each bar of ivory velvety smooth and easy to lather . <PARA> “ it floats ” was added to ivory ’ s slogan in 1891 . as for where the product ’ s name came from , p & g took inspiration from the 45th psalm : “ all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of ivory palaces .” <PARA> the famous “ 99 . 44 / 100 % pure ” slogan came about as the result of laboratory analysis : <PARA> this famous slogan <MASK> in the 1800 ’ s when samples of ivory were sent to college chemistry professors and independent laboratories for analysis . comparison tests were made with castile soaps — the standard of excellence at that time . one chemist ’ s analysis was in table form with the ingredients listed by percentage . harley procter totaled the ingredients which did not fall into the category of pure soap — they equaled 56 / 100 %. he subtracted from 100 , and wrote the slogan “ 99 - 44 / 100 % pure ®: it floats .” this became a pledge of quality to ivory consumers . this phrase is so identified with ivory , it ’ s registered as a trademark with the united <MASK> trademark office . <PARA> barbara “ tickled by the ivory ” mikkelson",2011-05-21T12:26:48+00:00,train_1136,train,misinfo

1,"in january 2020 , snopes readers inquired about a meme that had been circulating on facebook since july 2019 : <PARA> the meme presented three <MASK> , which we unpack below : <PARA> the above - displayed meme did not specify a specific <MASK> or branch of government , implying all democrats were responsible for the actions in question ; however , the first <MASK> in the meme (“ democrats killed a bill for tuition assistance for children of veterans killed in battle ”) was similar to one we rated “ <MASK> ” in april 2019 as it pertained to new york <MASK> . <PARA> and regarding that bill , “ killed ,” as the meme <MASK> , is a strong word in this context , given that similar legislation was still listed as in committee and potentially set to take effect april 1 , 2020 , at the time of this writing . however , it ’ s <MASK> that in 2019 democrats in a committee of the <MASK> new york assembly voted to block a bill expanding the <MASK> ’ s tuition aid program covering so - called “ gold star ” families , defined as immediate relatives of service members who “ lost their lives while engaged in hostilities , as a result of an international terrorist attack , or under certain other circumstances .” the bill proposed offering “ free tuition ” not just to gold star families but also to dependent family of service members who died while performing official military duties . <PARA> to be clear : the blocked bill proposed expanding the <MASK> ’ s military enhanced recognition incentive and tribute ( merit ) scholarship program to include family members of those killed or disabled in non - combat situations . the merit program already provides tuition and other assistance to family members of military personnel killed or disabled while engaged in ( or training for ) hostilities . <PARA> in other words , the children of someone “ killed in battle ,” as the meme put it , would seem to qualify for the existing tuition - assistance program . the proposed extension of funding would have also covered family members who were killed or disabled while not in combat . <PARA> it should be noted for what reason the democrats stopped the bill . according to newsday : <PARA> not wanting to wait , gov . andrew cuomo , a democrat , announced a plan on april 17 , 2019 , to immediately grant tuition assistance to family members of all new york service members who were killed while performing any official duties , effectively providing a stop - gap until the new legislation took effect in 2020 . <PARA> so while democrats did indeed block a tuition - assistance bill for families of service members who were killed or disabled outside of combat , this applied only in new york <MASK> and tuition assistance remained available to families of service members who were killed or disabled while in service . <PARA> the second <MASK> (“... then approve subsidizing the education and healthcare of illegal immigrants ”) was similar , in part , to one we rated as “ mixture ” in february 2019 . <PARA> as we previously reported , new york ’ s dream act ( not to be confused with proposed federal legislation of the same name ) allows undocumented high school students to qualify for in - <MASK> , college - tuition assistance to public universities and community colleges . <PARA> again , this legislation applied only to new york <MASK> . <PARA> it is <MASK> that some medicaid and children ’ s health insurance program ( chip ) benefits have been extended , with various conditions and exceptions , to immigrants of varying <MASK> in a few <MASK> , including new york . <PARA> while the idea of promising health care to “ undocumented ” immigrants has certainly received support among democratic presidential candidates leading up to the 2020 election , it is not a nationwide benefit , as the meme may suggest . <PARA> finally , it ’ s worth noting that the order of events presented in the meme is misleading , as the new york <MASK> dream act was passed before the tuition - assistance bill . <PARA> given the kernels of truth presented in this overall oversimplified and misleading presentation , we rate this <MASK> as “ mixture .”",2020-02-03 21:05:06+00:00,test_970,test,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : the realm of popular wisdom is replete with well - traveled factoids that found their way into our culture via a deliberate hoax or playful leg - pull . such is the case with the notion that the brassiere was invented by the so appropriately named otto titzling . <PARA> according to an inventive <MASK> of the undergarment that is now widely believed , titzling came to invent the item while living in a new york boardinghouse in 1912 . one of his neighbors was a buxom opera singer named swanhilda olafson , and the structural engineering problems she presented inspired titzling <PARA> to create a contraption to uphold this lady ’ s ample bosom . in the early 1930s , a french fellow named phillip de brassiere began producing a similar undergarment . titzling sued , but brassiere won in court , and that is why today we call a lady ’ s frontal uplifter a brassiere instead of a titzling . <PARA> it ’ s a great <MASK> , but there ’ s no truth to it . the madness began with a 1971 book by wallace reyburn titled bust - up : the uplifting tale of otto titzling and the development of the bra . like his 1972 send - up , the inferior sex : a treatise on the inferiority of women , bust - up was a work of satire . ( reyburn wasn ’ t always a jokester , however . although his biography of thomas crapper has often been dismissed as a hoax , flushed with pride : the <MASK> of thomas crapper was actually on the up - and - up , if somewhat inaccurate .) <PARA> the brassiere has been around in one form or another at least since greek women wore a chest binding called a mastodeton or apodesmos while exercising . when to date the invention of the modern brassiere to presents a bit of a problem — it depends upon how one defines the <PARA> contraption . <PARA> metallic constructions that looked like bras and did serve to hold matters rigidly in place were around as early as 1859 , as a patent granted to henry s . lesher of brooklyn , ny , shows . however , to think of this monstrosity as a garment would be to equate medieval armor with a leisure suit . <PARA> closer to the concept was clara p . clark ’ s 1874 “ improved corset ,” a fabric construction that bore a resemblance to today ’ s long - line bra . the fundamental element of her design was the pattern for a fabric breast pocket system held up by shoulder straps that crisscrossed the back . <PARA> olivia p . flynt ’ s 1876 “ bust supporter ” could possibly be pointed to as the <MASK> brassiere provided one accepts shoulder straps that look more like the shoulder yokes of an ordinary blouse . flynt designed a <MORE> removed from today ’ s undergarments to render his creation unrecognizable as a proto - bra . <PARA> most experts , however , point to 19th - century french feminist herminie cadolle as the <MASK> inventor of the brassiere and the date of the invention as 1889 . <PARA> upon moving to argentina in the mid - 1800s , cadolle opened a shop selling fancy french underwear . the enterprise flourished , turning cadolle into a globetrotting businesswoman . her active lifestyle and busy schedule soon convinced her there just had to be a better foundation garment for women like her than the then - universal and very uncomfortable corset . <PARA> in 1889 she moved back to paris , there to set up her main shop . she soon after began work on the task of engineering a better undergarment . the top half of her 1889 two - part invention was “ designed to sustain the bosom and supported by the shoulders .” ( the bottom half was a corset that covered only the waist and rear .) cadolle named this two - piecer le bien - être ( the wellbeing ). <PARA> by 1905 , the two - piecer had become two separate pieces , with the top half coming to be called a soutien - gorge ( throat support ). <PARA> how and when the modern bra gained the name we now know it by remains unclear . “ brassiere ” is an ambiguous word to attempt to trace because it was around a long time before anyone thought to use it as the name for a woman ’ s breast - holding undergarment . it had been employed since 17th century by the french , <MASK> meaning a soldier ’ s arm guard or shield . eventually , it came to mean any kind of upper - body harness with arm straps . by the beginning of the 20th century , “ brassiere ” had come to be synonymous with “ bodice .” by the 1920s , it had come to identify cupped breast support garments , which is where the word remains today . <PARA> according to the oxford english dictionary , the word means “ a woman ’ s undergarment worn to support the breasts .” <PARA> who connected that word with that meaning , however , is unknown and possibly unknowable . some say an american named charles de bevoise christened it thus in 1902 . others assert that the word turned up in an 1890 issue of vogue magazine , and others dispute them , saying it didn ’ t appear there until 1907 . <PARA> barbara “ bra brawl ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : bette midler sings about otto titzling and his wonderful invention in the 1988 movie beaches and on her 1986 album , “ mud will be flung tonight .” also , a trivial pursuit game card incorrectly gives the inventor of the bra as otto titzling .",2011-11-01T11:57:08+00:00,train_8053,train,misinfo

1,"in late january 2019 , a chain message with the subject “ why does trump want this wall so badly ?” began to spread through inboxes , on social media , and on reddit . the answer , according to an anonymous author , was that “ the steel slats trump wants to use ... are manufactured in the u . s . by a steel mill co - owned by a russian - israeli billionaire named roman abramovich .”: <PARA> these three paragraphs blended factual <MASK> about abramovich with unverified assertions to create a narrative at odds with reality . for this narrative to be <MASK> , each of the following <MASK> would need to be <MASK> : <PARA> it is <MASK> that abramovich is a well - connected russian oligarch with some ties to the trump family , and it is <MASK> that abramovich owns the only mill in the united <MASK> capable of producing 480 - foot , steel rails ( a product touted for its utility in the train industry ). however , president trump , who has changed his view multiple times on what his wall should look like , has not once made “ 480 - foot steel rails ” an immutable part of that plan . this conspiracy theory hinges primarily on that final <MASK> assertion . <PARA> roman abramovich is a russian - israeli billionaire who , among other things , owns the chelsea premier league football club and is also the largest shareholder of the multinational , russian - based steel company evraz . after being granted israeli citizenship in may 2018 , abramovich became the world ’ s richest israeli . he is identified as a russian oligarch ( based on his “ closeness to the russian regime and ... net worth ”) and appears on a u . s . treasury list produced as part of sanctions legislation president trump reluctantly signed into law . abramovich ’ s presence on this list does not necessarily mean he is subject to u . s . sanctions , though . <PARA> abramovich is friendly with the trump family , mainly through his wife , dasha zhukova . in 2014 , ivanka trump and jared kushner spent four days in russia at the invitation of zhukova , where “ they sat at the same table along with a few other people during a high - powered fundraising dinner for moscow ’ s jewish museum ,” according to bloomberg . jared kushner , bloomberg reported , had also been invested in an art business whose founding partner was zhukova , and “ ivanka trump , kushner and his brother , joshua , have accompanied zhukova to sporting events in the new york area .” zhukova , a politico reporter noted , attended the trump inauguration as a guest of ivanka trump . <PARA> abramovich ’ s steel background has inspired past speculation about possible quid - pro - quos between the trump administration <MORE> regardless of design , will involve large quantities of steel which could theoretically be produced by a u . s .- based , evraz - owned steel mill . but the supposed “ smoking gun ” link in support of the notion that the steel it will have to produced by evraz is that president trump ’ s latest wall machination supposedly requires the use of “ 480 sq ft steel rails ” ( which we interpret to mean “ 480 - foot - long steel rails ”, as the latter is actually a real commodity ). <PARA> such a requirement would certainly be provocative , as it does appear that one evraz - owned steel mill in colorado is the only such facility within the united <MASK> capable of producing that length of rail . the train industry is quite interested in these super - long rail lengths , as they reduce the amount of welding required for track construction or repairs . in november 2006 , the denver post reported on evraz ’ s acquisition of the colorado - based rocky mountain steel company , <MASK> that it would become the only american facility to produce those 480 - foot - length rail sections : <PARA> the only problem ? we have not identified a single instance of president trump ’ s <MASK> a requirement that the border wall use 480 - foot - length steel rails , nor have we found any rationale for why such a length would be efficacious in border wall construction . trump ’ s descriptions of his proposed border wall have shifted repeatedly since it was first raised as a talking point on 5 august 2014 , and such descriptions have never been heavy on technical specifics . during most of the 2016 presidential campaign trump described his barrier as a concrete wall , but in an about - face he said in late 2018 that the wall would be made with “ artistically designed steel slats ,” tweeting a rudimentary design of such a “ steel slat barrier ” on 21 december 2018 : <PARA> using this schematic and some basic math , the washington post ‘ s philip bump calculated that the barrier proposed by president trump in this version of his plans would be built using 28 . 4 - feet - high by 10 - inch - wide steel slats with 13 - inch spikes on top , separated from each other by a 9 - inch gap . none of this , to our ears , screams “ 480 sq foot steel rails .” <PARA> the notion that trump and abramovich are corruptly colluding to provide a massive contract for a russian - based steel company via a steel southern border wall ( whose existence , let alone design , has yet to be approved in congress ) appears to be unfounded speculation rooted in a manufacturing requirement for the wall that trump never actually <MASK> .",2019-01-31T02:26:26+00:00,test_36,test,misinfo
1,"on the evening of 11 september 2012 , islamic militants attacked the american diplomatic compound in benghazi , libya , killing u . s . ambassador j . christopher stevens and u . s . foreign service information management officer sean smith . several hours later , a second assault by militants that targeted a different u . s . facility about one mile away from the diplomatic compound resulted in the deaths of cia contractors tyrone s . woods and glen doherty . <PARA> this event ( commonly referred to as the “ benghazi attack ,” the “ battle of benghazi ,” or simply “ benghazi ”) is one that has been raised frequently by opponents of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton . critics contend that clinton , who was the u . s . secretary of <MASK> at the time of the attack , failed to take proper measures to ensure the safety of american personnel <MASK> in benghazi and has declined to accept responsibility for the incident ever since . <PARA> this subject once again reared its head during the 2016 presidential campaign , when hillary clinton appeared on msnbc and in response to a question from interviewer chris matthews , asserted that “ we didn ’ t lose a single person ” in libya . clips of that appearance were quickly posted on youtube and circulated via social media , along with messages mocking and deriding clinton for supposedly “ forgetting ” about ( or glossing over ) the deaths of four americans in benghazi : <PARA> however , such clips featured only a 53 - second long truncated portion of clinton ’ s remarks ( beginning with clinton ’ s defending u . s . actions in libya , and concluding abruptly with the “ didn ’ t lose a single person ” <MASK> ), thereby eliminating vital context . the entire segment was over eleven minutes long and began with matthews ’ first challenging clinton about her vote for war in iraq before shifting ( at about the 5 : 47 mark ) to ask her about her support for military intervention in libya . <PARA> the truncated clip began ( at approximately the 8 : 11 mark ) directly after clinton told matthews that u . s . intervention in libya had concluded with “ eventually defeating [ libyan leader muammar gaddafi ] and his forces ”: <PARA> without the <MASK> context , it wasn ’ t clear to viewers that clinton was referring to a military action in libya that took place during a particular timeframe . she didn ’ t “ forget ” about or ignore the four american deaths in benghazi ; rather , she was specifically discussing events that took place prior to the benghazi attack . the truncated version of the video effectively cut out clinton ’ s explanation and justification of u . s . military intervention in libya in 2011 , as well as the context that her remarks were completely unrelated to benghazi . <PARA> clinton ’ s comments ended abruptly in the truncated video directly before she clarified the context of her <MASK> . just as clinton ’ s reference to the end of the gaddafi regime was chopped from the start of clip , so was the portion of her <MASK> following “ we didn ’ t lose a single person ”: <PARA> had the second part of clinton ’ s response not been cut from the more widely viewed truncated clip , it would have been clearer to viewers that the former secretary of <MASK> was referencing the 2011 nato military intervention in libya . the attack in benghazi during which four americans were killed occurred on 11 september 2012 , nearly a year after military action in libya involving the united <MASK> and other nato allies officially concluded on 31 october 2011 . <PARA> clinton had already come under fire for a separate portion of the same interview , unrelated to united <MASK> intervention in libya . immediately after the segment aired , she was <MASK> accused of “ admitting ” that she had accepted a tacit bribe from the white house in exchange for her vote in support of a u . s . invasion of iraq .",2016-03-17T07:00:00+00:00,train_438,train,misinfo

0,"this <MASK> discussed the potential implications of a case that was , at the time of writing , undecided by the supreme court . on 17 june 2019 the supreme court decided that case , rejecting arguments that could have resulted in a stronger presidential pardon . far from kavanaugh ’ s being a deciding vote on the case , the court ruled 7 - 2 against the notion that federal and <MASK> prosecution for the same crime violates the so - called “ double jeopardy clause ” of the constitution . justices ruth bader ginsburg and neil m . gorsuch dissented . <PARA> on 29 november 2015 , a motorist named terance gamble , who had been convicted of second degree robbery seven years earlier , was pulled over by an alabama police officer because of a faulty headlight on his vehicle . upon searching the car , the officer found a handgun , among other items . it is illegal under both alabama law and united <MASK> law for convicted felons to possess firearms , and gamble was eventually sentenced to one year in prison on that charge by the <MASK> of alabama . <PARA> during gamble ’ s prosecution under alabama law for possession of a firearm as a felon , the federal government also charged him with the same crime . gamble ’ s lawyers argued that this second conviction was a violation of the u . s . constitution ’ s ban on “ double jeopardy ,” which is intended to protect people from being prosecuted for the same crime more than once . the double jeopardy clause is found in fifth amendment to the u . s . constitution , which <MASK> ( in part ) that “ no person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb .” specifically , the clause has been interpreted to be a prohibition on : <PARA> gamble has been in federal prison since entering a guilty plea on 18 october 2016 that allowed him to appeal his case . in june 2018 , the supreme court agreed to hear his argument that he has been unconstitutionally punished multiple times for the same crime . while the case is about the constitutionality of a man being charged twice for the same gun possession incident in a narrow sense , the case more broadly has the potential to significantly alter 150 years of supreme court precedent . <PARA> since the 1850s , the supreme court has allowed for one explicit exception to the constitution ’ s double jeopardy protections : cases of dual sovereignty ( or “ separate sovereigns ”) which stem from view that the federal government and <MASK> governments are distinct entities with occasionally overlapping jurisdictions . ( exceptions to this exception exist which seek to limit double prosecutions at the federal level , but as this case shows they do not always have that effect .) <MORE> with the founding fathers ’ vision of <MASK> and federal government duality : <PARA> in this case , gamble has explicitly asked the supreme court to rule on a single specific question : “ whether the court should overrule the “ separate sovereigns ” exception to the double jeopardy clause .” <PARA> the reason gamble v . united <MASK> is generating buzz from people other than constitutional law scholars is that the separate sovereigns exception also prevents president trump from pardoning people for <MASK> crimes . under current supreme court precedent , a presidential pardon of an individual does not prevent that individual from being prosecuted for the same or similar crimes under <MASK> law . “ under the dual sovereignty doctrine ,” adam j . adler wrote in the yale law review , “ as long as two offenses are defined by different jurisdictions , they cannot constitute the ‘ same offense .’” <PARA> the congressional research service issued an august 2018 report on the potential ramifications of the case , and this report included a discussion of its possible effect on the presidential pardon power : <PARA> some pundits have speculated that the reason why certain politicians seem to be in a rush to seat judge brett kavanaugh on the supreme court is that is that he has a notably strong view of presidential powers and therefore would be a vote in favor of gamble and for an expansion of presidential pardon powers — and the supreme court announced they would be hearing this case the day after justice kennedy ’ s retirement . this temporal proximity has prompted some commenters to opine that the rush might be motivated by a desire to limit the president ’ s legal liability in the russia probe and other investigations : <PARA> while we cannot speculate on the motives of politicians who are supporting judge kavanaugh ’ s nomination , the atlantic reported that prominent political legal scholars agree in a general sense with the view of this case ’ s having importance with regard to president trump ’ s pardon power : <PARA> the atlantic also reported that at least one member of the senate judiciary committee who approved kavanaugh for a floor vote before the full senate , orrin hatch , has publicly weighed in on the topic ( unmotivated , he says , by the implications for the pardon power ), filing an amicus curiae brief in favor of gamble which argued that “ the pervasive federalization of criminal law to cover conduct that traditionally was prosecuted and punished by the <MASK> , and that falls within the <MASK> ’ core legislative interests , threatens to undermine the protections of the double jeopardy clause unless the dual sovereignty doctrine is overruled in this context .” <PARA> oral arguments for the case have not been scheduled but will occur during this supreme court term . if confirmed , judge kavanaugh could become a deciding vote in the case .",2018-10-03T20:37:10+00:00,train_1705,train,info

( for example , the account of fraternity members at the university of washington being caught in possession of stolen sheep while “ dressed in their underwear , with white grease on their hands and peanut butter and other substances on their bodies ” was in fact reported in the chronicle of higher education .) <PARA> where the hippo - dwarf incident ostensibly took place isn ’ t even clear , as the three - sentence summary <MASK> above is ambiguous : was the deceased an austrian dwarf working for a circus of indeterminate locale , or was he a dwarf of unidentified nationality employed by an austrian circus ? either way , since many circuses typically engage in tours , we can ’ t assume his fatal plunge took place in austria . nonetheless , despite conducting extensive searches of databases that index newspapers from the u . s . and around the world , we have been unable to find any <MASK> that this news <MASK> ran in the las vegas sun ( or any other newspaper ) prior to its initial appearance on the internet or in national lampoon . <PARA> the closest items we could find were 1990 news stories from the uk about a three - ton hippo named hilda ( apparently a popular appellation for the large creatures , perhaps due in part to the influence of popular children ’ s books written and illustrated by richard scarry ) who briefly escaped onto the grass verge of the a303 near thruxton , hampshire , after the trailer carrying her from longleat safari park in wiltshire to windsor safari park overturned . ( unfortunately , hilda did not survive the process of being tranquilized and re - loaded into the truck .) <PARA> the “ hippo eats dwarf ” tale experienced a renaissance when it was published by thailand ’ s pattaya mail newspaper in 1999 . that version set the incident in northern thailand , changed the ill - fated dwarf ’ s name to “ od ,” and added some rather dubious details ( such as noting that hilda was “ a vegetarian who had not previously digested a circus performer ” and that the police sent the circus trampoline out “ for forensic analysis ”): <PARA> the pattaya mail ‘ s account was quickly picked up and re - published by several australian newspapers , including the daily telegraph , the advertiser , and the sunday mail , leading to another round of “ look at this genuine news <MASK> !” sightings . the <MASK> has continued to grow since then , picking up even more loopy embellishments about vegetarianism , alcoholism , and laxatives along the way : <PARA> scanned copies of various newspaper re - printings of the pattaya mail <MASK> have been circulated on the internet , lending credence to the notion that “ hippo eats dwarf ” was a creditable news <MASK> : <PARA> the express ‘ “ beachcomber ” columnist penned a tongue - in - cheek column about the phenomenon of the mutating “ hippo eats dwarf ” tale a few years ago , in which he noted : <PARA> based on the lack of any reputable source to document the expiration of a trampoline - bouncing austrian circus dwarf at the hands ( er , mouth ) of a hippopotamus amphibius , we have to opt for the former alternative ( i . e ., practical joke masquerading as fact ). its truthfulness notwithstanding , the famous headline has since been memorialized as the name of an auckland band .",2006-07-19T22:06:58+00:00,dev_1217,dev,misinfo

( born 1936 ), was a kenyan who came to america at the age of 23 and attended the university of hawaii , where he met and married stanley ann dunham — a marriage that produced one son , barack obama jr ., who is now president of the united <MASK> . however , barack obama sr . and ann dunham separated when their son was but a small child ; the former returned to kenya to work as a government economist , while the latter embarked on another marriage with an indonesian national named lolo soetoro ( born 1935 ). barack <PARA> obama jr . lived with his mother and stepfather in indonesia for four years , then from the age of ten onwards he lived with his maternal grandparents , stanley armour dunham ( born 1918 ) and madelyn lee payne dunham . <PARA> obviously barack obama ’ s biological father could not have served in the u . s . armed forces during world war ii , as barack obama sr . was then a child living in kenya who was but nine years old when the war ended , nor could obama ’ s stepfather have served during the war , as lolo soetoro was then a child in indonesia who barely turned ten the year world war ii ended . <PARA> however , despite the difference in generations , stanley dunham was the person who most functioned as a father in barack obama ’ s formative years , as dunham helped raise and care for barack from the age of ten onwards in hawaii while barack ’ s stepfather , lolo soetoro , remained in indonesia . clearly barack obama ’ s mention of a veteran relative who came home from world war ii and “ got the services he needed ” was a reference to stanley dunham , who did in fact enlist in the military shortly after the japanese attack on pearl harbor and served as a sergeant with the u . s . army in europe during the war . either barack obama referred to him as his “ father ” because that ’ s the way he thinks of him , or because he simply misspoke and said “ father ” instead of “ grandfather .” <PARA> likewise , during an appearance in new mexico on memorial day in 2008 , barack obama made reference to an uncle of his “ who was part of the first american troops to go into auschwitz and liberate the concentration camps .” critics quickly pointed out that such a circumstance was impossible ( primarily because auschwitz was liberated by soviet forces , not american troops ) and similarly accused senator obama of telling a lie . but his <MASK> was simply a mistake , not a lie : barack obama ’ s uncle , charlie payne , was in fact part of a group of american troops who helped liberate a concentration camp , but that camp was at buchenwald , not auschwitz .",2010-08-02T10:02:03+00:00,train_5424,train,misinfo

1,"in the summer of 2020 , multiple readers asked snopes to investigate <MASK> that former u . s . vice president and presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden had called for an end to “ shareholder capitalism .” <PARA> in july and august , facebook users shared posts that contained the following text : <PARA> “ biden wants to end shareholder capitalism ... that ’ s your 401 [ k ]... your pensions ... your retirement ... are you voting for that ?” <PARA> another social media meme suggested that biden ’ s proposals would result in the destruction or liquidation of 401 ( k ) pension savings : <PARA> those memes did not accurately reflect remarks made by biden in july 2020 on the subject of “ shareholder capitalism .” <PARA> at a july 9 event in dunmore , pennsylvania , biden gave a relatively conventional stump speech , hitting on several familiar themes — his working - class upbringing in nearby scranton , the values he inherited from his family , and his vision for an american economy that , according to him , places less emphasis on corporate profit , and a greater emphasis on rewarding hard work and smaller - scale entrepreneurship , especially in the context of the covid - 19 coronavirus pandemic , which <MASK> some smaller businesses and left millions unemployed . <PARA> as part of this broader “ wall street versus main street ” theme , biden said the following ( emphasis added ): <PARA> biden did not propose dissolving the stock market , or prohibiting the public trading of companies , or shareholder investment and dividend . in saying “ it ’ s way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism ,” biden was taking a position in a long - running ethical debate between “ shareholder ” and “ stakeholder ” theories . <PARA> one academic has helpfully summed up that philosophical conflict as follows : <PARA> in the short video below , philosopher and professor of business administration r . edward freeman — arguably the primary advocate for stakeholder theory — outlines the approach : <PARA> biden characterized the era of shareholder capitalism as one in which the following idea holds sway — “[ that ] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders .” his rejection of that principle was classic stakeholder theory : “ that ’ s simply not <MASK> , it ’ s an absolute farce . they [ companies ] have responsibility to their workers , their community , to their country .” <PARA> we asked the biden campaign for details on any specific proposals the former vice president had , or how exactly he envisioned an end to “ the era of shareholder capitalism ,” but we did not receive a response in time for publication . <PARA> although those details were not available , it ’ s clear that biden was not calling for the abolition of shareholding itself . rather , he proposed bringing an end to the era of shareholder capitalism , meaning an end to the predominance of that particular ethical approach and a new gravitation towards the stakeholder - driven approach , a position that , whether or not one agrees with its tenets , has in recent years become orthodox among progressives , within the democratic party , and even among business leaders themselves . <PARA> in 2019 , for example , the business roundtable — an influential group of chief executive officers of some of the largest companies in the united <MASK> — executed a high - profile shift in its approach , writing : <PARA> “ since 1978 , business roundtable has periodically issued principles of corporate governance that include language on the purpose of a corporation . each version of that document issued since 1997 has <MASK> that corporations exist principally to serve their shareholders . it has become clear that this language on corporate purpose does not accurately describe the ways in which we and our fellow ceos endeavor every day to create value for all our stakeholders , whose long - term interests are inseparable .” <PARA> what biden called for in his dunmore speech was therefore , as he rightly said , not a “ new or radical notion .” it was not an end to the stock market nor the ability of individuals to buy and sell shares , and therefore it was not a proposal that would cause pensions to evaporate , as several facebook memes <MASK> <MASK> .",2020-08-06 22:01:27+00:00,test_415,test,misinfo
0,"the one present roy collette wasn ’ t looking forward to getting for christmas 1988 was those damned pants . yet he knew he was in trouble as soon as the flatbed truck bearing a concrete - filled tank off a truck used to deliver ready - mix rolled up . sure as god made little green apples , those pants had to be in there . and he was going to have to fish them out , else declare his brother - in - law the winner of a rivalry that had then spanned 20 years . <PARA> being the sport he is , brother - in - law larry kunkel thoughtfully supplied the services of a crane to hoist the concrete - filled tank off the flatbed . <PARA> what ’ s this game , you ask ? what was the significance of these pants , and why were two grown men going to such efforts year after year to retrieve them , only to send them off again ? <PARA> it all began in 1964 when larry kunkel ’ s mom gave him a pair of moleskin pants . after wearing them a few times , he found they froze stiff in minnesota winters and thus wouldn ’ t do . that next christmas , he wrapped the garment in pretty paper and presented it to his brother - in - law . <PARA> brother - in - law roy collette discovered he didn ’ t want them either . he bided his time until the christmas after , then packaged them up and gave them back to kunkel . this yearly exchange proceeded amicably until one year collette twisted the pants tightly and stuffed them into a 3 - foot - long , 1 - inch wide pipe . <PARA> and so the game began . year after year , as the pants were shuffled back and forth , the brothers strove to make unwrapping them more difficult , perhaps in the hope of ending the tradition . in retaliation for the pipe , kunkel compressed the pants into a 7 - inch square , wrapped them with wire and gave the “ bale ” to collette . not to be outdone , collette put the pants into a 2 - foot - square crate filled with stones , nailed it shut , banded it with steel and gave the trusty trousers back to kunkel . <PARA> the brothers agreed to end the caper if the trousers were damaged . but they were as careful as they were clever . as the game evolved , so did the rules . only “ legal and moral ” methods of wrapping were permitted . wrapping expenses were kept to a minimum with only junk parts used . <PARA> kunkel next had the pants mounted inside an insulated window that had a 20 - year guarantee and shipped them off to collette . <PARA> collette broke the glass , <MORE> and welded the safe shut . the safe was then shipped to kunkel , who was the plant manager for viracon ’ s outlet in bensenville . <PARA> the pants next turned up in a drab green , 3 - foot cube that once was a 1974 gremlin . a note attached to the 2 , 000 - pound scrunched car advised collette that the pants were inside the glove compartment . <PARA> in 1982 kunkel faced the problem of retrieving the pants from a tire 8 feet high and 2 feet wide and filled with 6 , 000 pounds of concrete . on the outside collette had written , “ have a goodyear .” <PARA> in 1983 the pants came back to collette in a 17 . 5 - foot red rocket ship filled with concrete and weighing 6 tons . five feet in diameter , with pipes 6 inches in diameter outside running the length of the ship and a launching pad attached to its bottom , the rocket sported a picture of the pants fluttering atop it . inside the rocket were 15 concrete - filled canisters , one of which housed the pants . <PARA> collette ’ s revenge for the rocket ship was delivered to kunkel in the form of a 4 - ton rubik ’ s cube in 1985 . the cube was made of concrete that had been baked in a kiln and covered with 2 , 000 board feet of lumber . <PARA> kunkel “ solved the cube ,” and for 1986 gift - giving repackaged the pants into a <MASK> wagon filled with 170 steel generators all welded together . because the pants have to be retrieved undamaged , collette was faced with carefully taking apart each component . <PARA> news accounts didn ’ t record the form in which the pants were passed in 1987 , and their 1988 packaging ( concrete - filled tank ) was mentioned at the beginning of this page . sadly , 1989 ’ s packaging scheme brought the demise of the much - abused garment . <PARA> collette was inspired to encase the pantaloons in 10 , 000 pounds of jagged glass that he would then deposit in kunkel ’ s front yard . “ it would have been a great one — really messy ,” kunkel ruefully admitted . the pants were shipped to a friend in tennessee who managed a glass manufacturing company . while molten glass was being poured over the insulated container that held them , an oversized chunk fractured , transforming the pants into a pile of ashes . <PARA> the ashes were deposited into a brass urn and delivered to kunkel along with this epitaph : “ sorry , old man here lies the pants ... an attempt to cast the pants in glass brought about the demise of the pants at last .” <PARA> the urn now graces the fireplace mantel in kunkel ’ s home .",1999-12-28T08:00:00+00:00,train_5391,train,info

1,"<MASK> : while the additional revenues flowing into civilian communities from nearby military installations are always greeted <PARA> with open arms , those members of the forces who arrive in town bearing those dollars often are not . locals view sailors , soldiers , and air force personnel on leave as marauding hordes , out to get drunk , start fights , wreck property , and despoil the womenfolk . an uneasy truce frequently exists in such towns , with the area ’ s permanent residents paying lip service to the military ’ s being a welcome addition to the locale even as they regard its personnel with barely disguised suspicion and mistrust , and the military folks sensing ( if not openly experiencing ) this lack of hospitality . <PARA> those in the services do often feel about as welcome in town as the proverbial skunk at a picnic . this sense of being barely tolerated is sometimes expressed as a prevalent ” sailors and dogs keep off the grass ” attitude on the part of the townspeople , a reference to a sign numerous old salts <MASK> to have encountered in u . s . ports where they have been <PARA> <MASK> . <PARA> however , anecdote aside , no one has produced convincing <MASK> of such notices having been a common sight anywhere in the u . s . while prank versions do exist ( such as the doormat displayed in the graphic above ), real photos of real signs or sightings of same by reliable sources ( e . g ., contemporaneous news accounts , historians ) are sparse . for instance , norfolk ’ s venerable and prolific historian george holbert tucker said he never once saw a ” dogs and sailors ” sign , and little escaped his notice in his 80 - odd years of familiarity with that city ’ s local lore . <PARA> those in the military have a folkloric <MASK> of being regarded as sources of contamination by the civilian population . in 1943 , for instance , one of the tales dealt with by a <MASK> clinic run by a reno , nevada , newspaper fretted about the spread of venereal disease to local children who frequented a <PARA> municipal swimming pool also used by soldiers . in the civilian mind at least , soldiers were presumed to be riddled with sexually - transmitted diseases . <PARA> “ no dogs or sailors ” signs have purportedly been sighted in a variety of u . s . cities across a span of 50 - odd years , from the 1930s to the 1970s . the most commonly - encountered version of the <MASK> places the offensive notices in norfolk , virginia , during the 1940s : <PARA> in late 1946 , carl meriwether didn ’ t care where the navy sent him , as long as it was somewhere else . <PARA> “ one night aboard ship , we were <MORE> of garbage anyway ,” lederman said . “ until the war started , you couldn ’ t go down the streets . soldiers , sailors and dogs , keep off the grass .” <PARA> the “ sailors and dogs : keep off the grass ” chestnut enjoys the acceptance it does because it communicates via one succinct and cold - hearted phrase how many in the military perceive themselves to be treated by the locals . as an expression of something deeply felt yet difficult to put into words , the text of these signs gets across that sense of barely being tolerated . in this regard , it is far less important that the signs might not have ever existed in the u . s . because the feeling being communicated by them certainly does . <PARA> yet if the signs themselves are potentially american fiction , where did belief in them come from ? <PARA> that may well have sprung from the tales of a seaman who traversed the seas about a century before sailors began swearing to one another they ’ d run into these signs in the u . s . in before the wind , the memoirs set down by captain charles tyng in the years before his death in 1879 , is found this passage describing his first voyage in 1815 and a sign encountered at cowes on the isle of wight ( a small island lying just south of england ). <PARA> i went into the boat ashore at once , and walked up a little ways from the boat to a small woods , to see how things looked on land , and feeling that i was in a civilized country , i thought i should enjoy the sight after being at sea so long — when to my surprise and disgust i noticed a sign stuck up with “ dogs and sailors are forbidden to trespass here ,” and that is about all the impression i have of cowes at that time . <PARA> captain tyng ’ s 25 - year career as a seaman brought him to the norfolk area on many occasions , so he had innumerable opportunities to repeat this yarn to various sailors he encountered there and in various seafarers ’ haunts across a span of many years . he also likely shared it with his shipmates , who in turn would present it to others of their acquaintance as an example of the hard lot of a seaman ’ s life . because its core message ( that sailing men are viewed as contaminations of orderly society and so meant to be made feel unwelcome and quickly sent on their ways ) strikes a universal chord among others similarly given the cold shoulder , the <MASK> would be quickly seized upon as a telling example of the sort of callous handling military personnel have themselves been subjected to . <PARA> barbara “ naval gazing ” mikkelson",2010-04-29T11:31:28+00:00,dev_1213,dev,misinfo

1,"on 10 july 2014 , a post to the new york city craigslist “ rants & raves ” subforum titled “ busy nyc restaurant solves major mystery by reviewing old surveillance ” was published and subsequently deleted . ( an archived copy can be found here .) in the post , a person <MASK> to represent a popular and busy unnamed new york city restaurant <MASK> the venue ’ s numerous “ mystery ” poor reviews were surprisingly explained by an in - depth review of older surveillance tapes compared to ones from 2014 . since it was posted ( and deleted ) in july 2014 , the <MASK> has traveled far and wide on the internet , garnering more than a million cumulative shares on sites such facebook ( and has since created mistaken impressions among readers that its <MASK> were part of a “ study “). <PARA> according to the <MASK> poster , a decline in customer experience ratings prompted the restaurant ( which has never been identified despite widespread circulation of the <MASK> ) to hire a consultancy firm and audit their practices to discover the source of the poor reviews . the poster <MASK> the consultants concurred with customer feedback about slow service and recommended the restaurant review “ old surveillance tapes ” to determine which staff practices might have prompted the decrease in diner satisfaction . <PARA> the post began by explaining the restaurant ’ s local standing and its recent decline in customer satisfaction : <PARA> first and foremost , it ’ s possible ( though perhaps not likely ) this missive was genuinely written by a person who works for , manages , or owns a busy and popular restaurant in new york city . it ’ s also possible the surveillance tape review occurred and diners in 2014 we found to behave differently from diners in 2004 . <PARA> however , one curious point readers were left pondering after perusing the post ’ s initial <MASK> was this : the writer <MASK> to represent a restaurant in new york city that was both “ busy ” and “ popular ,” located within a city that is home to innumerable restaurants to which those descriptors could reasonably apply . if the conclusions drawn by the poster about smartphone use in restaurants affecting customer experience were accurate , how could all those well - trafficked and well regarded new york city restaurants not be experiencing a corresponding drop in service satisfaction ? is this the only restaurant in manhattan to see rampant cell phone use among diners ? <PARA> many readers were also skeptical about whether the approach supposedly suggested by the consultancy firm ( i . e ., to review old surveillance tapes ) is one commonly proffered to flagging restaurants , whether restaurants are expected to archive mundane surveillance tapes for a decade or more , whether the reviewing such tapes is a useful tool for assessing staff performance on any meaningful <MORE> requesting their checks . then after the checks were delivered to the tables , the 45 parties ( or diners ) purportedly each spent 15 minutes more lingering in the restaurant than they did in 2004 , presumably playing candy crush and ignoring one another . <PARA> finally , the poster capped off his or her rant with a concluding <MASK> : of the 45 tapes reviewed ( salvaged from just one of “ 4 special sony systems recording multiple cameras ”), eight of the diners or parties remained so absorbed in their smartphones ’ screens that they bumped into other customers or staff while exiting the venue . while folks texting and walking have occasionally been known to pose a nuisance , nearly a quarter of restaurant diners running into other people seems to be an excessive proposed rate of collisions . <PARA> ultimately , no restaurant ever stepped forward to own up to the rant . it was never determined to be linked to a specific venue in new york city , and no other restaurants <MASK> a similar deterioration of customer behavior over the ten years between 2004 and 2014 . the post could have been written by a disgruntled restaurant worker or owner ; however , the way it ’ s structured suggests the writer ’ s gripe was not with poor reviews at a restaurant but with the technophobic belief that an increase in smartphone and social media usage is a detriment to society and social experiences . whether or not that opinion translates to poorer restaurant reviews is not proved , nor is it supported by any <MASK> or study ; nonetheless , the tale has proliferated due to a strong ( if not subtle ) inherent message that smartphone users are boorish and inconsiderate , and the devices are definitively detrimental to human behavior . more plausible than a genuine rant is an individual distaste for the widespread use of such devices couched as a shocking discovery inside one imaginary restaurant . <PARA> even if the <MASK> presented did stem from an actual restaurant ’ s audit of surveillance video , a number of factors ( such as location , management , pricing , or menu fluctuations ) went unaddressed in the spotty analysis . an argument could just as easily be made for a positive impact on business due to smartphone proliferation : a number of diners now locate their next restaurant experience on the fly using geolocation - enabled apps and pay for dinner with their phones . additionally , it ’ s not uncommon for customers to boost a venue ’ s profile or reach by sharing glowing reviews on social media sites and posting images of enticing dishes that basically serve as free advertising . and there ’ s no reason why , if such devices were truly as disruptive as the poster described , this nuisance wouldn ’ t measurably extend into social spaces beyond dining establishments .",2014-11-19T08:00:00+00:00,train_1076,train,misinfo

1,"we now accept as commonplace the notion that actors in popular television shows are set for life financially , as we read about how cast members in hit shows such as “ friends ,” “ seinfeld ,” and “ the big bang theory ” not only were paid upwards of $ 1 million per episode during those series ’ initial runs , but then earned millions of dollars more in residuals and royalties from syndication deals , dvd sales , and video streaming . <PARA> that wasn ’ t always the case , however . the actors from television shows of decades past — shows whose episodes have been continuously rerun countless thousands of times all over the world and are touchstones of popular culture — did not reap any such bounty . those cast members were typically paid salaries that ranged from modest to pretty good , and they may have received additional payments for the first few airings of episodes in which they appeared , but that was it — they collected little or no residuals when their shows were sold into syndication , and no royalties from a home video market that didn ’ t yet exist . <PARA> as eve plumb , who portrayed jan brady on the 1970s sitcom “ the brady bunch ,” revealed in 2011 : “ the biggest misconception is that we ’ re all rich from it , but we are not . we have not been paid for reruns of the show for many , many years . we are not making money off of it at all .” <PARA> the one notable exception to this circumstance , according to legend , is actress dawn wells , who played the character of mary ann summers in the 1960s sitcom “ gilligan ’ s island .” numerous websites such as mental floss have offered versions of the following tale about how wells supposedly parlayed her three seasons on the show into a lifetime of paychecks : <PARA> this narrative seems quite improbable on its face . actors are generally represented by a bevy of various unions , guilds , agents , and lawyers , and the idea that only one person in the whole television industry possessed the savvy to recognize that a contractual entitlement to residuals was a potentially lucrative reward worth pursuing strains credulity . <PARA> moreover , the goal of most television producers in that era was to keep their shows going long enough ( generally three years ) to amass a sufficient number of episodes for syndication deals after those series ended their <MASK> network runs , as the syndication market provided the bulk of potential profits . while producers may not have expected their shows to still be airing “ 40 years later ,” they certainly hoped their series would enjoy long tv afterlives , and they would not be keen on sharing those revenues with actors who had little bargaining power ( nor would they want to set a precedent for other actors to follow ). a minor actor in a secondary role who dared to press for a contractual guarantee to perpetual royalties likely would have been curtly informed how quickly and easily she could be replaced . <PARA> we don ’ t need to speculate on the <MASK> of 1960s television to know the answer here , though , because wells herself has repeatedly <MASK> that this legend is <MASK> . in 2014 , for example , wells said during an interview that she was paid a salary roughly equivalent to $ 50 , 000 in today ’ s dollars and “ never received any residuals ”: <PARA> and in a 2016 interview , she answered the question , “ what ’ s one big myth about [ gilligan ’ s island ]?” by asserting that the actors “ didn ’ t really get a dime ” in residuals : <PARA> a 2014 washington post obituary of wells ’ cast mate russell johnson , who played the professor , also observed that johnson “ resented ... that he and other cast members were left out of the bulk of the syndication profits .” <PARA> for what it ’ s worth , the daughter of “ gilligan ’ s island ” creator sherwood schwartz disputed the oft - repeated <MASK> that her father realized as much as $ 90 million from the series :",2019-11-06 01:14:23+00:00,test_632,test,misinfo

19 coronavirus disease misinformation spreading across social media or chat apps takes the form of copied - and - pasted “ advice ” posts attributed to anonymous “ experts ”. these posts are usually riddled with scientific errors and / or promises of cures . here we look at two such “ cure ” posts that involve hot water and lemons . <PARA> one <MASK> , attributed to a chinese researcher , implores readers to “ use as much natural vitamin c ” as possible and suggests lemons as a good source . to that point , the post <MASK> that regular consumption of a drink made from three lemon slices and hot water helps “ against the spread of [ covid - 19 ]” and “ destroys the virus .” while vitamin c does play a role in several immune system functions , its use as a treatment to prevent or cure viral infections is unsupported by science . <PARA> a second , slightly modified <MASK> is attributed to “ information ” that “ comes from israel ” and includes the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the hot lemon water cure . unlike the previous assertion , which rests largely on <MASK> about vitamin c , this cure allegedly works because it can “ alkalize the immune system .” the ubiquity of this concoction in israel , the post additionally <MASK> , is why the country has seen no cases of the disease . this is <MASK> . “ alkalizing the immune system ” is an illogical pseudoscientific concept , and at this time of this reporting , israel had over 2 , 300 confirmed covid - 19 cases . <PARA> this dubious <MASK> , which now circulates in text form on social media platforms , has its <MASK> in a video shared extensively on facebook messenger and created by the owner of the youtube channel “ mrhealthychannel .” even before any medical information is presented , several red flags are apparent . “ hi , i am jiao shenme mingzi from china , researcher at the school of medicine zanjan university ,” the post begins . zanjan university is in iran , and , as politifact noted , this person ’ s alleged name closely resembles the phonetic spelling of “ jiao shenme mingzi ,” which is not a name but a phrase used to ask for <MORE> for reference , that single lemon cut into three slices and served with hot water contains about 30 milligrams of vitamin c . <PARA> the nih does suggest that “ vitamin c supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity ” as well as provide some potential benefit to certain populations of people with compromised immune systems . as dr . caroline apovian , a professor of medicine and pediatrics at the boston university school of medicine , explained to usa today , “ the only impact that vitamins and supplements may have in any cold or flu is to lessen the severity .” as such , the assertion that a single lemon served with hot water will “ kill the spread of this virus in our body ” is unsupported by science . <PARA> this iteration of the lemon and hot water cure comes from a viral copy - pasted - and - reshared bit of text on facebook that usually begins with the <MASK> <MASK> that the information comes “ from israel where this virus did not cause any deaths .” as previously noted , israel has in no way been immune to the coronavirus pandemic , nor are they , as the post also asserts , “ relaxed about the virus .” on march 25 , the israeli government announced — like other governments around the world — measures to limit the movement of its citizens in order to slow the disease ’ s spread . <PARA> the alleged science here is just as straightforward to debunk . the ability to “ alkalize ” one ’ s body was a popular <MASK> promoted by scientists in the 1920s and by supplement peddlers and health gurus today . but unless you suffer from certain specific and medically catastrophic conditions like metabolic acidosis , it is effectively impossible to alter , through diet , the ph of the cellular environment that makes up the various tissues of your body , including those of the immune system . the body maintains these environments in a tightly controlled range : a ph between 7 . 36 and 7 . 44 in arteries , and around 7 . 2 in intracellular spaces . the only ph value in your body that you would be altering with your diet is the ph of your urine . such a modification would provide no medical benefit to the fight against a viral infection . <PARA> lemon and hot water used as a vitamin c therapy will not “ kill ” or “ slow the spread ” of covid - 19 , nor would it provide a clinically significant amount of vitamin c to begin with . a buffered solution of hot lemon juice and sodium bicarbonate , similarly , will do nothing to change the ph of either your body or your immune system . for these reasons both lemon -

1,"while many of us like our ice cream unadorned , some could not properly enjoy a cone of their favorite flavor without its first being dipped into or sprinkled with jimmies , a colored candy decoration commonly used on ice cream , cupcakes , and donuts . however , as the example above illustrates , for some it ’ s a guilty pleasure because they ’ ve been told their preferred name for the multi - hued sweet sprinklings packs a racist wallop : <PARA> the dictionary of american regional english defines jimmies as “ tiny balls or rod - shaped bits of candy used as a topping for ice - cream , cakes and other sweets .” this confection goes by many names , including ‘ sprinkles ’, ‘ nonpareils ,’ and ‘ hundreds and thousands ,’ but even among those who refer to them as ‘ jimmies ’ there is contention — some say all colors of this topping are properly styled ‘ jimmies ,’ while others assert only the brown ones are called that , with other shades of the sweet stuff being termed ‘ sprinkles .’ <PARA> there are two theories as to why anyone might think there ’ s a racist connotation to the name : one focuses on the brown color of what some say are the only <MASK> jimmies ; the other posits that the name is a reference to jim crow , the title character in a well - known minstrel song of the 1830s . ( jim crow quickly became a slang term for anything having to do with african - americans , particularly items of a racist bent , such as the jim crow laws that segregated blacks from whites in the south .) <PARA> no valid reason exists to suppose that ‘ jimmies ’ carries a racist meaning or had a racially - charged <MASK> . however , it ’ s difficult to definitively disprove the <MASK> because the term ’ s entry into the english language is downright murky . <PARA> the theory cited most often attributes the naming of the confection to the just born company , a candymaking operation founded in brooklyn in 1923 who now produce such popular treats as ‘ peeps ’ and ‘ mike and ike .’ just born have long maintained that not only did they come up with the name “ jimmies ,” but they invented the product ( i . e ., chocolate sprinkles ) as well : <PARA> the notion that just born “ invented ” chocolate sprinkles is specious , however , as newspaper references to chocolate sprinkles antedate the founding of the company : <PARA> but even if just born didn ’ t invent chocolate sprinkles , could they at least have been the source that first called them “ jimmies ”? beth kimmerle , author of candy : the sweet <MASK> , ventured the opinion that just born created the term “ jimmies ” as a <MORE> and manned the machine that made the confection . however , that too may be myth , as just born co - ceo ross born couldn ’ t positively confirm “ jimmy ”‘ s surname . also , certain respected slang dictionaries ( such as cassell ’ s dictionary of slang and random house historical dictionary of american slang ) trace “ jimmies ” to the 1920s , which would place the naming of the item prior to the purported machine operator ’ s stint with just born in 1930 . <PARA> as to how else the term could have entered the language , another theory suggests it as a short form of the venerable english slang word jim - jam . while jim - jam has a number of meanings , one that ’ s been around since the 16th century is “ a trivial <MASK> or knick - knack .” by the lights of the jim - jam theory , the “ trivial ” aspect of that one particular meaning translated to the confection now called jimmies . <PARA> however , that theory has a number of holes in it . first , according to the oxford english dictionary ( which is the bible of word histories for the english language ), the only meanings common to both jim - jam and jimmies have to do with delirium tremens and the heebie - jeebies — the “ trivial ” meaning of jim - jam does not seem to have moved over to jimmies . second , at no point have the candy sprinkles been called jim - jams , a link in the etymological chain one would expect if the one were a shortening of the other . <PARA> throwing yet another log on the fire , a 1993 boston globe item <MASK> that “ the <MASK> of the name is apparently unknown , but we found this hard - to - take - too - seriously reference in an old file : an ( unnamed ) ice cream maker <MASK> that in 1901 constance bartlett of pottstown , pennsylvania , after grating chocolate over ice cream for her son ’ s birthday , reportedly told other children they couldn ’ t eat them because ‘ they ’ re jimmy ’ s .'” <PARA> sometimes words just sneak into a language without anyone ’ s knowing , years after the fact , how that process came about . yet no matter how jimmies became part of common parlance ( as with many other terms , its <MASK> may ultimately prove untraceable ), no substantive <MASK> demonstrates anything denigrative of african - americans was tied to the <MASK> of the name : <PARA> it may be the case that among those who refer to dark brown or chocolate sprinkles as “ jimmies ” and other colors simply as “ sprinkles ,” someone simply assumed a potentially racist connection was at work and retroactively invented an explanation for it .",2009-09-26T07:00:00+00:00,train_1021,train,misinfo

0,"although random halloween candy poisonings are confined to the realm of urban legendry , many actual cases of tampered trick - or - treat loot involving the insertion of pins , needles , or razor blades have been documented . <PARA> these cases constitute a different class of tampering than poisoning for a couple of reasons . first , the expected level of harm is severely reduced : poison is an attempt to kill ; a pin in an apple is an attempt to frighten or injure . professor joel best reported that he was able to track about eighty cases of sharp objects in food incidents since 1959 , and almost all were hoaxes . only about ten culminated in even minor injury , and in the worst case , a woman required a few stitches . compared to “ eat something and die ,” a couple of stitches barely registers on the scale . <PARA> second , the motivation for “ pins and needles ” tampering is different . as i said before , poison is an attempt to kill , but hiding a needle in an apple is almost always a prank , not a serious attempt to cause harm . ( in those instances where such an insertion could be traced back to a specific person , it was almost always some kid intent on freaking out either his little brother or his parents or getting the community in an uproar as his version of a cute halloween “ trick ”). pranking ( especially when it ’ s a scary or slightly mean one ) is part of halloween , and the various kids or young adults who ’ ve tampered with treats most likely never fully considered the potential consequences of the joke prior to embarking on it . ( when presented with a matchless opportunity to throw a scare into a pesky kid brother , who stops to think that junior might get hurt ?) <PARA> according to the minneapolis star tribune , an incident that broke with this expected pattern occurred in minneapolis in 2000 , when 49 - year - old james joseph smith was charged with one count of adulterating a substance with intent to cause death , harm or illness after it was determined he ’ d put needles in snickers bars and handed them out to children on halloween . a 14 - year - old boy was pricked by a needle hidden in a bar he ’ d bitten into , but no one required medical attention . <PARA> according to reporting found later in december 2000 , smith was perhaps on his way to an institution for the “ mentally ill ” after he was deemed “ incompetent for trial .” <PARA> as author jack santino noted in his <MASK> of halloween , “ pins and needles ” <MASK> began to supplant “ poisoned candy ” <MASK> in the mid - 1960s , and nearly all such reports of such <MASK> proved to be hoaxes : <PARA> halloween of 1982 was the year it all went crazy . that year saw a number of tragic and random non - halloween poisonings of both foodstuffs and medicines , including the tylenol poisonings that killed seven people . although the “ crazed madman tampering with kids ’ halloween treats ” had been an established bogeyman for at least the previous fifteen years , it was in the aftermath of the tylenol poisonings that a sudden spate of halloween tampering reports erupted . it ’ s as if the murder of those seven unfortunate people opened a forbidden door and now others were free to experiment with playing god , to dispense either life or death as the whim struck them .",2000-11-02T08:00:00+00:00,train_3888,train,info

carrying libertarian . i ’ ve been studying politics and political <MASK> for the past 30 years . my specialty is u . s . presidents . that said , i hope that the house of representatives impeaches trump . let me tell you what will happen next !” <PARA> the post went on to outline several purported stages in the impeachment process , <MASK> that the republican - controlled senate would vote against convicting trump , and that the process would ultimately backfire on the democrats , because once impeachment begins , lawyers for the president would be able to “ subpoena and question anyone they want .” <PARA> as a result , according to the viral message , republicans would interrogate several high - profile political or intelligence community figures who have either criticized or opposed trump or played a role in special counsel robert mueller ’ s investigations , thus revealing their supposed guilt in unspecified crimes — “ james comey , peter strzok , lisa page , bruce ohr , glenn simpson , donna brazille , eric holder , loretta lynch , christopher steele , hillary clinton , john brennan , james clapper , and a whole host of other participants in this whole sordid affair ...” <PARA> it ’ s not clear where the post first <MASK> , who wrote it , and whether “ hyram f . suddfluffel ” even exists or has a doctorate in political science . we discovered multiple versions of the “ impeachment backfire ” text , the earliest being in a june 3 post on the right - leaning political forum free republic . there , a user with the handle “ lonster ” outlined the theory , saying it had been “ passed on by an old friend ”: <PARA> the earliest version we found on facebook was posted on june 11 by a user going by the name “ john tunis .” that version did not attribute the message to any named person and did not include any mention of academic credentials : <PARA> during june and july , versions of the text were shared widely on facebook and , based on the submissions from snopes readers , via chain emails . twitter users began sharing it in august . <PARA> in some versions , no author is named . in others , especially <MORE> important <MASK> made in the post , and the one that has arguably caused it to be gleefully shared by supporters of the president , is that which relates to the ability of trump ’ s lawyers to subpoena and interrogate some of their client ’ s perceived foes : “ the president ’ s attorneys will have the right to subpoena and question anyone they want .” <PARA> it is <MASK> that the defendant in a senate impeachment trial can issue subpoenas . a document called the “ rules of procedure and practice in the senate when sitting on impeachment trials ” includes a formula of words for subpoenas in such trials , specifying that the subpoena can be issued on behalf of “ the party impeached , or of his counsel ”: <PARA> “ form of a subpoena be issued on the application of the managers of the impeachment , or of the party impeached , or of his counsel .” <PARA> despite this ability to issue subpoenas , it is not at all clear that the president ’ s legal team would be able to subpoena <MASK> or testimony from “ anyone they want ,” or at least , they likely wouldn ’ t be able to coerce the compliance of any and every target of their ire . <PARA> it ’ s not specified in the senate impeachment “ rules of procedure ,” but the rules of federal criminal procedure <MASK> that anyone issued a subpoena as part of a criminal trial ( on which congressional impeachment is loosely modeled ) can apply to the court to have the subpoena quashed . <PARA> they can do this on several grounds , including on the basis that the subpoena is “ unreasonable or oppressive .” multiple federal court precedents have held that the <MASK> and testimony requested under subpoena , in criminal trials , must be relevant to the case at hand , and cannot amount to a “ fishing expedition .” <PARA> though it ’ s not clear whether this jurisprudence would carry over into a senate impeachment trial , it would be reasonable to imagine that the same principles apply . if that is the case , then the president ’ s lawyers could not simply force a third party ( such as hillary clinton , james comey , eric holder , or any of the other figures mentioned in the post ) to provide any and all <MASK> requested , or answer any and every question put to them . <PARA> the <MASK> requested , and the testimony desired , would likely have to be relevant to trump ’ s defense against the specific allegations against him , under the <MASK> ( s ) of impeachment . however , since the rules governing impeachment proceedings are not the same as those that govern criminal trials , we can ’ t say definitively what the president ’ s lawyers might be allowed to do .",2019-09-27 19:11:25+00:00,test_487,test,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : mentos , a candy that has a soft , chewy interior encased in a slightly hard shell , is no longer just for noshing on — when combined with a carbonated beverage in a closed environment that <PARA> has a small opening ( think “ soda bottle ”), it serves to produce a frothy geyser that shoots many feet into the air , a secondary use of the product that has served to enthrall countless persons with a penchant for making things explode . <PARA> the combination of any carbonated liquid and mint - flavored mentos will rapidly produce copious amounts of foam because the candy works to disrupt the surface tension of the liquid , thereby releasing all the drink ’ s fizz ( carbon dioxide ) in one surprisingly speedy whoosh . the resulting effect is quick , high , and explosive , yet what takes place is not a chemical reaction but a physical one ( even though some are moved to believe the confection ’ s gum arabic component or diet soda ’ s aspartame has something to do with the process ). as steve spangler , former high school science teacher turned hands - on science guru , explained : “ the mentos effect has nothing to do with the inside of the mentos and everything to <PARA> do with the outside .” the candy ’ s shell is pocked with little nooks and crannies the beverage ’ s carbon dioxide molecules are immediately drawn to , and the confection ’ s relatively large surface area provides infinitely more such nooks and crannies ( nucleation sites ) than , say , an m & m would . <PARA> as for what happens when carbonated beverage encounters mentos , when a roll of the sweets is dropped into a two - liter bottle of diet coke , the combination works to produce an impressive geyser of brown froth that shoots about 20 feet into the air ( although some of these pressurized fountains have attained even greater height ). diet cola of any manufacture is regarded as the liquid of choice for creating a “ mentos eruption ” or “ mentos effect ” because a cola ’ s brown color serves to make the reaction much more starkly dramatic in all its explosive glory , and diet versions of those sodas don ’ t leave the same sticky residue that their sugared counterparts do ( an aspect well worth considering when contemplating spraying a wide area that you may afterward be called upon to clean ). plus , some folks swear diet sodas make for higher geysers . <PARA> numerous video clips of “ mentos eruptions ” exist on the internet ; one needn ’ t search all that diligently to stumble across scads of them . <PARA> not all such videos found on the web are on the up - and - up , however , including the famed “ pepsi girl ” <MORE> sorry fate began circulating on the internet in november 2006 . since no <PARA> checkable details are provided in the account ( the deceased is described as “ a little boy ” rather than by name , he died in “ brazil ” rather than in any particular city or region within that country , and his demise occurred “ last week ” rather than on a specific date ), the <MASK> should be regarded as fiction . no news accounts of such a death ( in brazil or elsewhere ) have surfaced , and given the media ’ s interest in “ mentos effects ,” such write - ups wouldn ’ t have gasped their last on a jaded editor ’ s desk because they weren ’ t deemed sufficiently newsworthy to include in that day ’ s edition of the local rag . likewise , with regard to “ one year before the same accident happened with another boy in brazil ,” once again the news is silent regarding such a death . <PARA> however , the failure of this explosive combination of candy and soda to cause any fatalities should not be taken as a ringing endorsement of chasing down a handful of mentos with as much pop as can be gulped . a harmless procedure it ’ s clearly not — one look at online video clips of the force of “ mentos effect ” eruptions shooting out of pop bottles should convince even the most adventurous not to risk any part of their digestive systems on such parlor tricks . those who have disregarded common sense and tried such anyway report that the intensity of the reaction forces the mouth open , thereby releasing most of the gas and foam into the wild , as it were , rather than keeping them contained within the person . do not try such experiments yourself though . videos of those who have attempted such foolishness consistently show the subjects experiencing great physical distress in the aftermath of their ill - judged stunts . <PARA> the “ child who died from combining mentos and coca - cola ” <MASK> is an updating of an older legend that began in 1979 . that year , the grist being run through the <MASK> mill included the sad tale of a misadventuring tot who had gulped soda and ingested pop rocks , a carbonated candy known for producing a fizzling sensation in the mouth . according to legend , said child went out with a bang . further versions of the <MASK> specified the deceased youngster was the taciturn “ mikey ” of life cereal commercials . <PARA> once again there hadn ’ t been such a child , but that did little to slow the <MASK> ’ s spread . the gruesome appeal of the combusted tot <MASK> kept the legend in circulation long after it had been repeatedly debunked and dismissed . <PARA> barbara “ fizzical attraction ” mikkelson",2010-07-31T23:44:16+00:00,train_7796,train,misinfo

name talent for the inauguration ceremonies , it is perhaps natural that the media would seize upon any report that a well - known individual might be performing . it also became a subject ripe for satire . saturday night live ’ s opening skit on 17 december 2016 featured trump ’ s publicist , kellyann conway , giving donald trump a list of “ all the people who have agreed to perform at your inauguration .” she hands trump a small , folded piece of paper . trump opens the note and nods his head , “ so many great names . i love them both .” the snl skit then showed a bare - chested putin climbing down the chimney like santa with an elf on the shelf toy ( a thinly disguised listening device ) as a present for trump . <PARA> on 18 december 2016 , the new yorker ’ s satirical “ borowitz report ” piled on to the trump - putin connection , mixed it with trump ’ s reported difficulties in finding big - name performers , and published a tongue - in - cheek <MASK> that vladimir putin had volunteered to sing for trump ’ s inauguration . “ in a brief <MASK> from the kremlin , putin said , ‘ i will be most delighted to perform for my comrade .’” borowitz then added that because he had received criticism for his plans to sing the russian national anthem , putin decided to perform a song more appropriate for russian - american relations : bette midler ’ s “ wind beneath my wings .” <PARA> other , more dubious news sources picked up on the “ borowitz report ” and re - ran the <MASK> , some appropriately labeling it as satire but others omitting that all - important detail . for example , the china christian daily simply repeated the “ news ” as if it were a legitimate <MASK> instead of satire . <PARA> still others added their own twists to the jape . instead of performing “ wind beneath my wings ” in person , the national report fake news site said , putin would instead be singing “ blueberry hill ” via satellite . putin is a busy man after all . national report added : “’ president putin wishes he could attend the festivities in person ,’ said the liaison , identified as althea thoonyev . ‘ logistics , prior commitments , matters of <MASK> , and security concerns necessitate performance via live video . glasnost was the beginning of a new openness throughout russia ,’ said thoonyev . ‘ president putin wishes to further bridge the perceived divide between our two nations using music — the universal language .’” <PARA> in reality , however , putin will not be singing at trump ’ s inauguration — in russian , english , “ the universal language ,” or any other language .",2017-01-09T21:36:39+00:00,train_49,train,misinfo

1,"scam : job seekers are lured into wiring part of the cost of their airfare for travel to exotic interview location . <PARA> <MASK> : typically , employment frauds in which gullible job seekers are duped into handing some of their money to con artists are designed to appeal to those seeking easy part - time work that can be performed at home ( e . g ., the reshipper scam , or various envelope stuffing cons ). this swindle , however , uses a different lure to entice the overly trusting down the primrose path : it holds out the prospect of glamorous work , often to be performed in exotic locales . <PARA> the scam is simple : newspaper ads offering high - paying travel - related positions are simultaneously run in a number of cities , or such job postings are listed online . whoever answers these ads is told he will be interviewed in a distant city for his dream job . almost as an afterthought , he will be informed the company requires him to wire money to cover a portion of his airfare , this being the corporation ’ s way of ensuring it isn ’ t wasting its resources on candidates that don ’ t bother to show up . the job prospect is given the promise of this sum ’ s being returned to him at his interview , making it seem to the pigeon that he will merely be out of pocket for a few days rather than lose the money permanently . all the while , the about - to - be - gulled is blinded with ongoing patter about fat pay checks , exotic locales , first - class accommodations , and life among the beautiful <PARA> people . <PARA> once the dupe has wired the specified sum to the thief working the con , he will either never again be contacted by the swindler ( who will ditch whichever disposable cell phone he used to make and receive these calls ), or he will be told there has been a change of plan , that instead of being jetted to some distant place for his tete -

( hitler was born in 1889 , whereas adolph coors was born in 1847 and founded his company in 1873 .) <PARA> the second factor — which is much harder to define — is the association of coors with a variety of right - wing causes and charities , and how this connection translates in some people ’ s minds to a tie to nazism .

and because estimates vary widely over how many feral cats actually live in australia . in a paper published in the journal conservation letters , the researchers wrote : <PARA> “ the focus on killing cats runs the risk of distracting attention away from other threats to biodiversity , most prominent of which is widespread , ongoing habitat loss , which has been largely overlooked in the threatened species strategy . the culling target is a highly visible symbol of a broader campaign around feral cat research and management in australia , rather than a direct indicator of conservation action and success . we are concerned that progress toward the 2 million target could be misinterpreted as progress toward conserving threatened species , when the link between the two is not clear .”",2019-04-30T00:27:40+00:00,train_1835,train,info

1,"below is a picture of a cfl light bulb from my bathroom . i turned it on the other day and then smelled smoke after a few minutes . four inch flames were spewing out of the side of the ballast like a blow torch ! i immediately turned off the lights . but i ’ m sure it would have caused a fire if i was not right there . imagine if the kids had left the lights on as usual when they were not in the room . <PARA> i took the bulb to the fire department today to report the incident . the fireman wasn ’ t at all surprised and said that it was not an uncommon occurrence . apparently , sometimes when the bulb burns out there is a chance that the ballast can start a fire . he told me that the fire marshall had issued reports about the dangers of these bulbs . <PARA> upon doing some internet research , it seems that bulbs made by “ globe ” in china seem to have the lion ’ s share of problems . lots of fires have been blamed on misuse of cfl bulbs , like using them in recessed lighting , pot lights , dimmers or in track lighting . mine was not in any of those . it was a normal light socket . <PARA> i bought these at wal - mart . i will be removing all the globe bulbs from my house . i have not decided yet if we are going back to incandescent bulbs at this point . <PARA> <MASK> : we first spotted this warning about a fire hazard associated with cfl bulbs ( accompanied by a photo of a bulb made by globe electric , a firm which has its head office in montreal but which manufactures its light bulbs in china ) in april 2010 . in its <MASK> form , the heads - up being circulated said “ i bought these at canadian tire or wal - mart ,” a <MASK> that places the item ’ s purchase point in canada , in that while globe does vend its cfl bulbs at wal - marts in canada , it does not do so at wal - marts in the u . s . later versions of the e - mail elided mention of the canadian hardware chain , thereby leading readers to assume the bulb had been purchased in the u . s . <PARA> cfls ( compact fluorescent lamps ) don ’ t burn out the way incandescent light bulbs do . instead , as they near the ends of their lives , they grow dimmer . while some cfl bulbs merely stop emitting light when they finally quit working , others kick the bucket with <PARA> a dramatic “ pop ”! sound and then vent a distinct odor . a few even release a bit of smoke at their termination . sometimes the bases of the bulbs turn black . this seemingly cataclysmic reaction has to do with the breakdown of the bulb ’ s ballast , which is contained in the part of the bulb that is screwed into the socket . as the bulb ages and degrades , so does its ballast . yet as scary as odors , smoke , and even blackening of the base of the bulb might be , these lamps are <MASK> and are meant to fail safely at the end of their lives . <PARA> john drengenberg , consumer affairs manager at underwriters laboratories ( ul ), said about how cfls expire : “ people expect to see the bright flash and to hear the popping like a traditional incandescent bulb , but the burn out of a cfl is different . the light dims over time and might produce a more dramatic pop , emit a distinct odor , and maybe even release some smoke .” <PARA> national geographic ’ s green guide says of cfls : “ bulbs burn out when the ballast overheats and an electronic component , the voltage dependent resistor ( vdr ), opens up like a fuse in your home ’ s fuse box , shutting off the circuit and generating heat and possibly a small amount of smoke . this might sound dangerous , but the vdr is a cut - off switch that prevents any hazards . the melted plastic you ’ re seeing where the glass coil connects to the ballast is simply a sign that the heat is escaping as intended in the design of the bulb .” <PARA> in a nutshell , healthy cfl bulbs may emit a bit of smoke and smell and have burnt - looking bases when they die , but that ’ s as it should be — there ’ s no fire danger to any of that , and indeed the bulbs are functioning properly when they act that way . <PARA> however , flames shooting out the side of a bulb is not the way things should be . it needs be kept in mind that any electrical device can malfunction , either through manufacturing defects or as a result of misuse by consumers . says globe of the bulb in the photo , “ as for this particular incident , the mention of flames / fire in the <MASK> is certainly outside of the norm and as such we would encourage the consumer to bring the bulb to their local fire marshal and / or safety authority to further investigate .” <PARA> there have so far been no reported or confirmed cases of fire involving globe - branded cfls . in october 2010 , however , the u . s . consumer product safety commission announced a recall of the chinese - manufactured trisonic brand of cfl bulbs due to “ four reports of incidents , including two fires that resulted in minor property damage .”",2010-10-06T23:01:30+00:00,train_2314,train,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : one thing that many visitors to the u . s . remark upon is that our money is kind of ... well , dull . redesigns of american currency undertaken in recent years ( primarily to incorporate anti - counterfeiting measures ) have added subtle bits of coloring to our primarily green bills and modernized the portraits featured thereon , but our federal reserve notes are in many ways still the same old greenbacks we ’ ve <PARA> been using for several decades . certainly the various denominations of u . s . currency aren ’ t nearly as colorful or distinctive as those of a country such as canada . <PARA> the examples of “ new ” u . s . currency shown above seemingly address some of those issues . although they may still be primarily green and still include images of the same founding fathers , 19th century presidents , monuments , and government buildings as our current bills , they present a distinctly different look than any currency the u . s . has previously issued , and they feature distinctive colored bands that aid in distinguishing between denominations at a glance . <PARA> but ... are they real ? <PARA> they ’ re not real in the primary sense that they aren ’ t designs that were commissioned by the u . s . government or are being considered or planned as a replacement for our current forms of currency . they ’ re purely the invention of graphic designer michael tyznik , who created them as his entry in the dollar rede $ ign project , basing his vision of currency redesign on the premise that u . s . bills are “ aesthetically lacking ”: <PARA> american banknotes are in dire need of a redesign . even though the green color of money is deeply interwoven into the nation ’ s culture , the need for color differentiation between denominations has forced the inclusion of color . the recent redesign of banknotes by the bureau of engraving and printing is poorly executed and aesthetically lacking . because the coloring of the current notes is so subtle , it is still hard to differentiate between denominations by that method alone . <PARA> my proposed redesign keeps the culturally important green color of money , but introduces a brightly colored holographic strip into each denomination , making them easy to tell apart . this strip includes embossed dots for the sight - impaired as well , making currency far more accessible . <PARA> my proposed redesign keeps the culturally important green color of money , but introduces a brightly colored holographic strip into each denomination , making them easy to tell apart . this strip includes embossed dots for the sight - impaired as well , making currency far more accessible . <PARA> viewing the full range of michael tyznik ’ s currency designs reveals that his set of federal reserve notes omits the $ 1 bill but includes a $ 200 bill . this is because , as mr . tyznik notes in his explanation , he advocates replacing $ 1 bills with one - and two - dollar coins ( as well as eliminating the penny entirely ). the reverse sides of his designs also incorporate a feature not currently found on u . s . currency : the text of the ten constitutional amendments that comprise the bill of rights . mr . tyznik explained the motivation for including this aspect in his designs thusly : <PARA> one of the most important things about america is our bill of rights . it is possibly the most important information any citizen can have . the design of our money currently contains semi - religious ( the eye in the pyramid ) and overtly religious (“ in god we trust ”) symbols and text that go against the incredibly important separation of church and <MASK> implicate in the first amendment . in my redesign , these are replaced with the text of the bill of rights . it has been proposed that these ten amendments are in order of importance , so it is fitting that the most important rights are included on the most common banknotes .",2009-08-06T23:08:44+00:00,dev_948,dev,misinfo

0,"on 17 june 2018 , right - wing blogs published a flurry of stories reporting that the administration of former united <MASK> president barack obama had handed immigrant children over to human traffickers . <PARA> the reports were posted in response to the public outcry over a policy enacted by obama ’ s successor , donald trump , whose administration in april 2018 announced a “ zero tolerance ” immigration policy . under this policy , all adults who are caught crossing the southern u . s . border between ports of entry are being charged with federal crimes and then separated from accompanying children . <PARA> as the policy went into effect , news reports documenting scenes of distraught , traumatized children being torn from their parents by immigration authorities , and images migrant children being held in cages , created a backlash from both sides of the political spectrum against the trump administration . <PARA> in response to the growing fallout , the president ’ s supporters wrote up stories criticizing his predecessor based on a 2015 criminal case and 2016 senate report stemming from a marion , ohio human trafficking ring that used migrant children for forced labor on an egg farm . right - leaning blogs like westernjournal . com ’ s conservative tribune for example confusingly reported the media was “ silent ” about the case while aggregating their <MASK> from a new york magazine report : <PARA> it ’ s an obviously <MASK> <MASK> that the “ left - leaning media stayed strangely silent ” about the case , because a simple google search reveals it has been thoroughly reported on by local and national outlets and is the subject of a pbs documentary film . as the text notes , conservative tribune ’ s own <MASK> was based on such reporting . <PARA> in july 2015 , the u . s . department of justice indicted a ring of traffickers led by aroldo castillo - serrano and accused them of smuggling children into the united <MASK> . they were also accused of lying to health and human services ’ office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) by posing as relatives in order to gain custody of children in its care and use them for forced labor in marion , a city north of columbus . the federal indictment , filed in u . s . district court in ohio accuses castillo - serrano and his conspirators of forcing the children to live in squalid trailers and work six or seven 12 - hour days a week , using threats and physical violence as coercion . <PARA> according to the justice department , castillo - serrano pleaded guilty in august 2015 to counts related to trafficking . he was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to the victims . <PARA> the case spurred a senate subcommittee investigation led by rob portman ( r - ohio ) which concluded the processes used by orr to screen sponsors “ are inadequate to protect the children in the agency ’ s care .” at the time , hhs lacked a system to screen potential sponsors for signs of trafficking , like accumulating multiple unrelated children . it did not physically assess homes children were being placed in and did not do adequate background checks on adults residing in those homes . the report found that in 2014 , “ hhs permitted a sponsor to block a child - welfare case worker from visiting with one of the victims , even after the case worker discovered the child was not living at the address on file with hhs .” <PARA> as a result of the investigation , hhs and the department of homeland security entered into an agreement to hammer out a joint plan that would address the issues raised in the report . as of 26 april 2018 , that still had not happened according to portman , who released a <MASK> blasting the agencies for their failure to take action . he wrote : <PARA> the issue of hhs ’ s lack of accountability for unaccompanied immigrant children came to a head in may 2018 when hhs acting assistant secretary of administration for children and families steven wagner told a senate oversight committee that the agency could not account for 1 , 475 children it had placed with sponsors from october to december 2017 . the furor over that <MASK> accompanied outrage over the trump administration ’ s “ zero tolerance ” policy , with critics raising concerns that the federal government was unnecessarily overwhelming an already -

1,"scams are omnipresent , but difficult economic times create an environment in which more people are more willing ( or desperate ) to be tempted by promises of “ free ” money . since early 2009 we have seen seen a marked increase in the prevalence of “ government grant ” scams , many of which are promoted as offering funds made available to the public through the economic stimulus package recently passed by the u . s . congress . <PARA> such frauds are typically touted to internet users through e - mails like the first example cited above or through a plethora of similar web - based advertisements , or to the off - line world through telephone solicitations . regardless of form , all such schemes produce the same end result : unsuspecting victims lured by the promise of “ free ” money or loans made available to them via government grants end up paying hundreds of dollars ( or more ) in up - front fees for grants that never materialize , leaving those who have been led to believe they were about to be enriched to the tune of thousands of dollars sadly disappointed and considerably poorer : <PARA> “ prepayment ” frauds are far from brand - spanking new : many successful flim - flams hold out the carrot of big money ( which never materializes no matter how hard it is chased after ) to seduce the gullible into parting with some of their hard - earned funds . those so gulled have acted on the belief they were arranging hard - to - secure loans at very favorable rates , often with distant countries said to be rabid with desire to lend to americans . or they were promised access to little - known and almost - forgotten college grants . or they received the news they ’ d won fabulous wealth in foreign lotteries they had no recollection of entering . even the venerable nigerian scam is a prepayment con : though its victims initially believe that for helping distressed foreigners move large sums of cash from their country they will receive millions of dollars , very early into the process they discover they will have to dole out innumerable sums to various folks to bring this about . folks conned via prepayment schemes mistakenly believe they stand to gain vast amounts of something for practically nothing . acting on that faith , they willingly part with funds they would ordinarily be loath to spend yet which by comparison to the prizes about to be gained momentarily appear to be relatively small sums . <PARA> the ‘ government grant ’ fraud operates on that principle . those who are contacted by such cheats ( or who respond to internet - based advertisements ) are told they are entitled to lay <MASK> to government grants worth thousands of dollars . in return for their banking information and / or what seems like <MORE> plus , and department of revenue . however , that a purported grant facilitation entity is not listed above in no way proves it is on the up - and - up , so no comfort should be taken from its absence . swindlers routinely invent impressive - sounding names and titles for themselves and the entities they supposedly represent . “ that ’ s what scam artists do ,” said pat coakley of the better business bureau , “ they operate under a variety of names and phone numbers , then leave town and start all over again under other assumed names .” <PARA> as to how the con is run , one of our readers who was contacted by someone intent upon victimizing him with the ‘ government grant ’ scheme reported this exchange : <PARA> as bryan experienced , the quite - reasonable question of “ why can ’ t you deduct the fee from the funds you ’ ll be sending me ?” is always countered by the <MASK> that it is impossible to do so . others who have been party to such come - ons report being told laws precluded the use of the grant ( or loan or scholarship or lottery prize ) for anything other that its designated purpose , which included barring use of even a small part of those funds for payment of processing fees . bryan ’ s example also shows how much he was pressured to provide his banking information . someone less aware of the possibility of being conned might well have given up that number under such a barrage . <PARA> the scam succeeds as well as it does thanks in part to the many television commercials touting free government money . ( such advertisers are vending books containing the contact information for a variety of government grants , loans , and subsidies .) though there are genuine government grants to be had , they are not available to just anyone for no purpose . forget about the ads on television or the internet — there are not untold troves of government funds available just for the asking . grants are awarded on the basis of specific criteria having been met for specific programs . such grants are very strictly administered , require the completion of a great deal of paperwork , and are overseen at every step . these are not “ fill out a simple form , then cash a huge check ” types of propositions ; these are “ prove to us that you qualify under this program then , provided you are engaged in the activity we are interested in fostering , we might subsidize some of your costs ” sorts of deals . the hoops to be jumped through are many and varied , and there is precious little by way of a freebie to it . <PARA> regarding the government grant scam , keep these three points in mind :",2009-02-27T04:37:36+00:00,train_3077,train,misinfo

0,"we first encountered this warning about straight ticket voting a few months before the 2008 presidential election , and it reappeared in july 2012 in anticipation of that year ’ s presidential election . the warning does have some merit to it , but it only applies to residents of a single <MASK> ( north carolina ). <PARA> when casting their ballots in elections , some voters choose to select candidates individually regardless of party affiliation ( i . e ., they may vote for a republican candidate for one office but a democratic candidate for another office ), while some voters choose to go with what is known as a “ straight ticket ” ( i . e ., they cast their ballots for all the candidates of one party ). the ballots in some <MASK> simplify the process of straight ticket voting ( stv ): rather than having to vote for every candidate from a particular party individually , the voter can fill in a bubble , or punch a hole , or mark a box , or pull a lever that is indicated as casting votes for all candidates of a specified party in partisan offices . <PARA> examples : <PARA> the item <MASK> above warns voters that selecting the straight ticket option may not result in their casting a ballot for their party ’ s presidential candidate because presidential selections have to be undertaken separately from the straight ticket voting process . voting processes vary from region to region , and as far as we know this warning applies only to north carolina , where straight ticket voting is available for all races except for presidential electors ; voters in that <MASK> ( regardless of party ) therefore need to specifically select a presidential candidate in addition to voting a straight ticket . <PARA> as the charlotte observer cautioned readers back in 2008 : <PARA> the best advice to ensure your votes count as you intend is to study a sample ballot in advance , read the ballot and voting instructions provided to you at the polling place carefully before casting your vote ( s ), and ask a poll worker for assistance if you are unsure about any aspect of the voting procedures . if you think you may have spoiled your ballot , do not hesitate to report the situation to a poll worker . <PARA> another thing to keep in mind is that some political parties may not field candidates for every single partisan office on a ballot , so by selecting a straight ticket you may end up not voting at all in some races . therefore , if you plan to vote a straight ticket , you might want to review your ballot first to verify that your party has a candidate running for every partisan office listed ( and also be sure to cast votes for non - partisan offices not included in the straight ticket selection process ). as they say , “ if you ’ re going to take the time to vote , take a few extra seconds and make every vote count .”",2008-10-16T00:09:00+00:00,train_8024,train,info

1,"as you may already know i have been a swat sniper for about 3 years . my specialty is counter sniper for presidential and dignitary protection . what this basically means is , i am posted at certain locations looking for a sniper / assassin . once a threat is detected , i am charged in countering his / her ability to attack by early detection and neutralizing ( killing ) him / her . <PARA> now on to business : <PARA> this sniper killing people in the dc metro area is a skilled sharpshooter and very calculated . unfortunately he appears very disturbed and has just left a calling card <MASK> he was god . what that probably means is he may escalate the matter by increasing the rate of killing in each attack because he acknowledges the police ’ s hot pursuit . this sniper knows it ’ s a matter of time before he is discovered . he thinks he is superior to everyone , but knows eventually he will be caught . he is playing a very sick game that he feels he is winning . he will probably want to sensationalize his confrontations with the police and eventually stop running and have a standoff . the police may be his future targets . <PARA> it is very important that you adjust your regular routine because this is a very deadly individual . i am going to give you my personal / professional advice on the matter . <PARA> the sniper ’ s mo ( his methods ) are the following . <PARA> a . 1st wave of attacks were concentrated in an area the suspect was very familiar with . <PARA> b . it appears these initial attacks were closer , probably less than 100 yards away . witnesses were hearing loud cracks . <PARA> c . he definitely is showing off . he is trying to maintain 100 %, one shot for one kill . ( sniper ’ s creed ). <PARA> d . he is probably not shooting the first person that appears . he is looking for the highest probable kill . this encompasses distance , position , and movement of the individual and excludes physical barriers <PARA> ( vehicles , tress , columns , etc ). <PARA> e . he is shooting from areas adjacent to major roadways , thoroughfares , highways , etc . ( quick egress ). first group was within a couple of miles from beltway . child shot in bowie was a block away from the us 50 on the 197 . <PARA> f . he went up to northern virginia ( 70 miles away ) to throw police off his trail ( diversion , used by snipers for stalking targets and eluding enemy ). <PARA> g . he is making this to be a giant “ stalk ” around the metro area . it is a game now . he wants them to come after him <MORE> “ if you look at where the night shootings have taken place , they were well illuminated ,” plaster said . “ think about how well lit a gas <MASK> is at night when you ’ re pumping gas .” <PARA> don bassett , a former fbi instructor who trained agents to be snipers , said people should make themselves difficult targets . anyone in an open area should keep moving — especially if the area is surrounded by woods or rolling terrain , he said . anyone getting out of a car should avoid the most brightly lit areas of service <MASK> or parking lots . <PARA> bassett said quiet , country roads may be safer than busy streets for taking a walk or a jog . he calls schools and service <MASK> “ target - rich areas ” because they see a constant flow of traffic . <PARA> “ i think he ’ s picking targets of opportunity that are more or less plums ,” bassett said . <PARA> people walking quickly are harder to shoot , he said . <PARA> plaster said people should also be aware when they ’ re standing in an area where they ’ re visible from more than 80 to 100 yards away . he said it ’ s not difficult for a trained marksman to hit a target from that distance . <PARA> “ i would try to be more alert , but at the same time you have to go on with your life ,” plaster said . <PARA> perhaps the larger issue is not whether these tips might somehow lessen one ’ s chances of becoming a sniper victim , but how practical they actually are . how many people can effectively train themselves to “ look for reflections ” every time they walk through foliage or approach buildings adjacent to shrubbery , remember to approach every doorway by walking in a “ zig zag ” fashion , or spend their days constantly looking around and over their shoulders while pointing at everything they look at and attempting to engage the attention of others ? and why stop with these tips ? mightn ’ t , for example , taking to wearing clothing that can serve as camouflage be even better ? <PARA> as always , a danger exists beyond the direct one created by the current crisis : that a large group of people — a whole suburban area , or even the entire country — can all too easily be paralyzed through fear and panic . that the average citizen can best help himself and others by being well - informed and aware is indeed good advice , but we must also be wary of being lured into the comfortable trap of thinking that “ things aren ’ t as dangerous as we feared ” ( or , worse , “ there is no danger ”) because someone has thrown a few simple tips our way .",2011-07-26T21:24:58+00:00,train_6991,train,misinfo

1,"editor ’ s note : fire experts warn that a plastic bottle containing any liquid — including , but not limited to , hand sanitizer — left in a car and exposed to direct sunlight can potentially focus sunlight into a beam hot enough to start a fire . the following <MASK> deals specifically with the specific <MASK> that hand sanitizer will “ spontaneously combust ” if left in a hot car . <PARA> in april 2020 , a series of photographs started to circulate on whatsapp and telegram that supposedly showed the aftermath of a car fire caused by an unattended bottle of hand sanitizer . <PARA> these posts , many of which were written in portuguese , urged people to be cautious about leaving hand sanitizer in their cars because , they <MASK> , it can spontaneously combust . <PARA> a month or so after these posts went viral in brazil , a similar <MASK> started to circulate on english - language pages . in addition to being spread by anonymous social media users , these warnings also made their way onto the pages of a real fire departments . the western lakes fire district of wisconsin ( wlfd ) in wisconsin , for instance , shared the following post to its facebook page on may 21 : <PARA> soon after , a number of news outlets picked up on this <MASK> and ran <MASK> about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars . although wlfd truly did post the above - displayed warning , the department later removed the post for stirring confusion . <PARA> for starters , the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame . a number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable , it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion . although this sort of fire may be technically possible ( more on that later ), we ’ ve yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way . lastly , the wlfd did <MASK> that a fire could be started via “ magnification of light through the bottle ,” but this is <MASK> for any plastic bottle and has little to do with its contents . <PARA> wlfd deleted its <MASK> hand sanitizer warning and replaced it with the following message : <PARA> judging from the amount of mail snopes received , many people were still confused about what dangers may lurk in bottles of hand sanitizer . so let ’ s take a closer look at the questions this viral post sparked . <PARA> many hand sanitizers contain alcohol , and these alcohol - based hand sanitizers ( abhs ) are flammable . the federal aviation administration wrote in a 2010 report : <PARA> hand sanitizers also give off vapors , and <MORE> to extreme heats ( over 700 degrees fahrenheit ) in order to spontaneously combust . <PARA> those sort of temperatures just aren ’ t going to be seen inside of a parked car ( so long as that car is parked on earth ). a 2018 study published in the journal temperature found that the average temperature in a parked car on a 95 - degree day was about 116 degrees . specific parts of the car , such as the dashboard , climbed closer to 160 degrees , but that is still far from the 700 degrees needed for spontaneous combustion . <PARA> the nfpa continued : <PARA> this <MASK> has more to do with the magnification properties of plastic bottles than it does with the contents of said bottles . in fact , in 2017 , a similar warning was circulated on social media that said leaving a water bottle in your car on a hot day could result in a fire . <PARA> live science wrote : <PARA> although it is technically possible for a fire to start in this manner , again , it is very unlikely . the sun , the bottle , and a flammable source would all have to be in perfect alignment on a rather hot day to ignite a fire . <PARA> in june 2020 , illinois ’ waukegan fire department reported that a small bottle of hand sanitizer had started a car fire . the organization later amended their <MASK> to clarify that the fire was started in the manner described above — a plastic bottle focusing direct sunlight into beam hot enough to start a fire — so its cause was unrelated to the substance in the bottle . <PARA> the <MASK> that hand sanitizer was causing car fires first gained traction in brazil in april 2020 via social media posts on whatsapp . this spurred the country ’ s corpo de bombeiros de campo grande ( campo grande fire department ) to issue a warning about the potential dangers of leaving hand sanitizer in a hot car . however , the fire department admitted that it had yet to see any fires caused in such a manner . likewise , we have yet to uncover any confirmed reports about hand sanitizer causing a fire while left in a parked car on a hot day . <PARA> however , many hand sanitizers are still flammable and do pose some risks . alcohol -

pronged approach : better border security and enforcement , a guest worker program with enhanced protections for the rights of immigrant workers and a system for employers to check the legal <MASK> of would -

time “ improper ” border crossings via criminal trials , a prosecutorial shift which has necessitated the mass separation of children from parents at the southwestern border ( a system we have written about in greater detail elsewhere ). <PARA> during his tenure as president , barack obama did oversee the criminal prosecution of some illegal border crossers ( as opposed to the traditional approach of administrative removal ), under a program known as operation streamline begun in 2005 during the administration of president george w . bush . however , this approach was still largely limited to repeat offenders or those with criminal records , and first - time “ improper ” entrants into the united <MASK> typically continued to be processed administratively before being deported . <PARA> crucially , the “ zero tolerance ” policy announced by attorney general jeff sessions in april 2018 prescribed the criminal prosecution of all individuals crossing the border unlawfully , even for the first time — a distinctive characteristic of the trump policy , and the one that brought about the separation of thousands of families at the border , during the spring and summer of 2018 . <PARA> president obama also oversaw an increase in the rate of deportations during his tenure as president , something that brought about the separation of some immigrant families already residing in the united <MASK> . but those families were not typically separated at the border , and this increase in deportations was partly attributable to a change in definitions used in compiling immigration <MASK> .",2018-08-02T22:14:52+00:00,test_241,test,info

( hostess is now owned by kansas city - based <MASK> bakeries corp .) the product ’ s name was inspired by a billboard in st . louis advertising twinkle toe shoes . when the world ’ s banana trade ground to a halt during world war ii ( this wasn ’ t the first time war disrupted the banana trade — the popular ditty “ yes , we have no bananas ” came out of world war i because of similar circumstances ), hostess substituted a vanilla cream filling not dissimilar to cake <PARA> frosting . <PARA> twinkies have a shelf life of twenty - five days , not seven years , and certainly not fifty years . even so , twenty - five days is an unusually long time for a baked product to stay fresh . the secret to twinkies ’ longevity is their lack of dairy ingredients : because dairy products are not part of the formula , twinkies spoil much more slowly than other bakery items . <PARA> after the baking process of the sponge cake portion is completed , cream filling is injected into each twinkie through three holes in its top ( brown ) side ; the product is then flipped before packaging , turning its bottom into its top . hostess estimates it uses eight million pounds of sugar , seven million pounds of flour , and one million eggs to produce the 500 million twinkies baked every year . <PARA> twinkies gained notoriety in american jurisprudence in 1979 when the media widely misreported the <MASK> that dan white , on trial for shooting san francisco mayor george moscone and city supervisor harvey milk , asserted that his consumption of junk foods such as twinkies “ had left him with diminished capacity for reason .” <PARA> according to hostess , it takes forty - five seconds to explode a twinkie in a microwave . <PARA> barbara “ and far less than forty - five for your mother to pitch a fit over it ” mikkelson",2012-11-19T12:07:20+00:00,train_2828,train,misinfo

1,"parents are having measles parties instead of vaccinating children ...

( read more fact checks like this one here .) <PARA> in other words , the emails <MASK> either biden or trump could serve as the country ’ s 46th president come inauguration day on jan . 20 , 2021 — even though biden won key battleground <MASK> , including michigan and pennsylvania , by comfortable vote margins and exceeded the 270 electoral college votes required to win the presidency . <PARA> the emails — like the president ’ s tweets that <MASK> <MASK> he had won or denied biden ’ s victory — were part of an aggressive disinformation campaign attempting to attack the integrity of america ’ s democratic process and convince supporters that trump had a significant chance to serve another term . <PARA> “ joe biden only won in the eyes of the fake news media . i concede nothing . we have a long way to go — this was a flawed election ,” said a nov . 19 campaign email obtained by snopes . <PARA> to unpack the underlying <MASK> — that american elections provide losing candidates an opportunity to defy the outcome of the popular vote — let ’ s first lay out the country ’ s steps for presidential elections under the constitution , federal <MASK> , and <MASK> laws . <PARA> every four years , when americans cast ballots in presidential elections , they are participating in the country ’ s popular vote . <PARA> that happened nov . 3 in the trump - biden race . days later on nov . 7 , biden was announced the winner of the popular vote based on the number of votes counted so far compared to the margin of votes between him and trump in key battleground <MASK> . ( read why and how journalists make that determination in presidential races here .) <PARA> typically , at that point in an election , the losing candidate acknowledges defeat by conceding to his opponent and addressing supporters in a speech . but trump not only did not do that , he and his allies went a step further by spewing the unfounded conspiracy theory that any person or group who acknowledged biden ’ s victory was working to undermine the president . <PARA> whether a candidate accepts the outcome of the popular vote or not , <MASK> officials at polling sites nationwide continue to count remaining ballots over the course of days or weeks , according to their respective rules . <PARA> that process , which historically is a procedural step to cement the outcome of the popular vote , requires governors to <MORE> the popular vote in minnesota , so that ’ s <MASK> ’ s certificate would list 10 democratic electors who pledged to vote for biden through the electoral college . <PARA> likewise , if , hypothetically , trump had won the midwestern <MASK> , the <MASK> ’ s certificate would list a different group of 10 people — electors who pledged to vote for the republican candidate . <PARA> all of this said , electors meet at <MASK> capitals in early december , weeks after election day , to formally cast votes for president and vice president , per guidelines outlined in the constitution . <PARA> no constitutional provision , nor any federal law , requires electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote ; however , the majority of <MASK> and the district of columbia have their own laws governing the electoral college and aim to keep electors from defying the popular vote . <PARA> here are specific deadlines for those above - described steps in presidential elections , per the associated press : <PARA> so , in short , a presidential election doesn ’ t end on election day , nor when a candidate is projected the winner by news media . rather , presidential elections officially conclude the following year , in january . <PARA> but it ’ s a <MASK> interpretation of <MASK> and federal laws governing presidential elections to consider those continuing steps after polls close on election day — when <MASK> certify results or choose electors , or the electoral college votes for president — as opportunities to defy the popular vote . <PARA> per analysis of the guidelines by constitutional experts and election academics , the post - election day procedures mainly serve to cement what voters decided at the county and <MASK> level . <PARA> we should note here : the emails from trump ’ s campaign alleging the election was “ far from over ” asked supporters to chip in to a so - called “ official election defense fund ” or “ election defense task force ,” both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge biden ’ s win . <PARA> but according to brendan fischer , director of the federal reform program at campaign legal center , the average donor ’ s money was not covering those expenses . <PARA> “ small donors who give to trump thinking they are financing an ‘ official election defense fund ’ are in fact helping pay down the trump campaign ’ s debt or funding his post - presidential political operation ,” fischer tweeted . <PARA> in sum , it was accurate to <MASK> the 2020 presidential election was incomplete as of mid - november . however , it was <MASK> to categorize the remaining procedures as reasonable opportunities for trump to overturn biden ’ s victory . for those reasons , we rate this <MASK> “ mostly <MASK> .”",2020-11-20 18:59:17+00:00,test_950,test,misinfo

air apologies for reporting the <MASK> about no - go zones incorrectly , including one in which anchor julie banderas offered a blanket apology to “ the people of france and england ”: <PARA> over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air regarding the muslim population in europe — particularly with regard to england and france . this applies especially to discussions of so - called ‘ no - go zones ,’ areas where non - muslims allegedly aren ’ t allowed in , and police supposedly won ’ t go . <PARA> to be clear , there is no formal designation of these zones in either country , and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion . <PARA> there are certainly areas of high crime in europe , as there are in the united <MASK> and other countries — where police and visitors enter with caution . we deeply regret the errors , and apologize to any and all who may have taken offense , including the people of france and england . <PARA> as is often the case , emersons and fox ’ s corrections did not travel as far or fast to those who saw and believed the <MASK> made during the fox news segment , and his retraction did not address the <MASK> he had made earlier about no -

1,"as talk of impeachment flooded the internet in september 2019 , we came across two <MASK> concerning the impact of the impeachment process on president donald trump ’ s reelection opportunities . <PARA> the first held that a president who was impeached by the house , but not convicted by the senate , could run for office two more times because the failed impeachment would nullify the first term . the second posited that if the house votes to impeach a president , but the senate doesn ’ t convict and remove the person from office , the president is barred from running for office again . <PARA> we ’ ll take a look at each of those theories below . but first , a quick look at how the impeachment process works . people often use the word “ impeachment ” when referring to the removal of a president from office . but that ’ s not exactly how it works . the house of representatives has the “ sole power of impeachment ,” as <MASK> in <MASK> i , section 2 , clause 5 of the u . s . constitution . but it is up to the senate to convict and remove a president from office . in this way , “ impeachment ” is roughly akin to bringing formal charges against an individual . it is then up to the senate to convict the individual on those charges . <PARA> the aforementioned theories both deal with the gray area between impeachment and conviction . in other words , what happens if the president is impeached by the house of representatives but is not convicted by the senate ? <PARA> theory 1 : if a president is impeached by the house but not convicted by the senate , the first presidential term is nullified and the president may run for election two more times . <PARA> <MASK> : this theory has been posited by a few social media users , but it reached a larger audience when it was shared by pizzagate conspiracy theorist jack posobiec : <PARA> the tweet reads : “ these democrats don ’ t realize that if they impeach trump and the senate doesn ’ t confirm it then it nullifies trump ’ s first term and he gets to run two more times . read the constitution , people .” <PARA> this is not how impeachment works . <PARA> before we get to what the constitution says about impeachment , we can get a glimpse of the hypothetical scenario posited in this tweet by taking a quick look at our country ’ s recent <MASK> . <PARA> president bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives on dec . 19 , 1998 . however , clinton was not convicted by the senate . we searched news reports from the time and found no serious reporters , historians , or politicians arguing that the senate ’ s failure to convict clinton literally <MORE> the house of representatives impeaches him . one twitter user , for instance , wrote : “ if he gets impeached he won ’ t be able to run in the next election like he plans to . it would guarantee that we can ’ t have 4 more years under his leadership .” <PARA> but that isn ’ t the case . a president who is impeached by the house but is not convicted by the senate could still run for reelection . <PARA> pennington told us : “ nothing in the constitution ’ s language on impeachment prevents a president impeached but not convicted from running for a second of a two - term maximum .” <PARA> in fact , before house speaker nancy pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into trump in september 2019 , political pundits noted that a “ failed ” impeachment could help trump ’ s reelection efforts . <PARA> an opinion piece in the hill noted : <PARA> however , a bit of truth is offered here . the constitution explains the country has two penalties for impeachment : removal from office and disqualification “ to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the united <MASK> .” if a president is impeached by the house of representatives , the senate could convict , remove the president from office , and disqualify the person from holding future office . <PARA> this scenario , however , falls into some gray area because it has never been tested at the presidential level . it is possible that the senate could take two separate votes , one on removal from office and one on disqualification from future office , which could result in a president ’ s removal from office but provide an opportunity to seek reelection . it ’ s also theoretically possible that a president who has been impeached , convicted , removed , and disqualified , could seek office at a lower level of government . <PARA> we asked pennington about the possibility of a president seeking reelection after the house has impeached and the senate convicted the person . he told us : <PARA> to sum up : although a president is impeached by the house of representatives , the repercussions of this legal process don ’ t come to fruition until the senate votes to convict the president . <PARA> if that happens , the senate can vote to remove the president from office and disqualify the person from holding future office . if the senate does not convict , the president will not be removed from office , nor will the person be prevented from seeking reelection ( if he / she has not already reached the two - term limit ). <PARA> nowhere in the constitution , however , does it <MASK> that a failed impeachment process would “ nullify ” a presidential term and allow a president to seek extra time in office .",2019-10-02 00:09:02+00:00,test_498,test,misinfo

1,"u . s . president donald trump was impeached by the democratic - controlled u . s . house of representatives on dec . 18 , 2019 . the house had brought two <MASK> of impeachment against trump : obstruction of congress and abuse of power . the charges stemmed from accusations that trump attempted to extort ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky by holding up crucial military aid in exchange for damaging information about one of trump ’ s potential 2020 presidential rivals . <PARA> during a senate impeachment trial that concluded on feb . 5 , 2020 , trump ’ s republican allies in control of the senate voted to acquit him ( with one republican , mitt romney , voting to convict ). <PARA> some snopes readers inquired about an interview given by u . s . house speaker nancy pelosi to cnn anchor christiane amanpour on feb . 15 , 2020 , in which pelosi appeared to <MASK> that trump was not really acquitted in the senate . <PARA> in the interview , pelosi said that because trump ’ s senate trial included no <MASK> or witnesses , the word “ acquittal ” does not apply . she said , “ you can ’ t have an acquittal unless you have a trial . you can only have a trial when you have witnesses and documents . so he can say he ’ s acquitted and the headlines can say acquitted . but he ’ s impeached forever , branded with that , and not vindicated .” <PARA> pelosi was referencing the fact that a slim majority of senate republicans had voted against admitting new witness testimony and documentary <MASK> into the trial , which was a strong point of contention with democrats . for example , john bolton , trump ’ s former national security adviser , <MASK> publicly that he would have been willing to testify if called . <PARA> pelosi ’ s opinion about the legitimacy of the senate trial aside , trump was in fact acquitted of the allegations made in the two <MASK> of impeachment , with republican majority votes to do so cast mostly along party lines . <PARA> the impeachment process shares some terminology with the criminal justice system , including employing terms like “ trial ,” “ acquittal ” and “ conviction .” however impeachment is a distinct process spelled out in the constitution and has its own set of rules and procedures . as we reported in october 2019 : <PARA> unlike in criminal cases , guilt and punishment are not determined separately in an impeachment trial . further , unlike in a criminal case , the senate has the sole discretion to determine the rules of the trial . therefore , one can ’ t determine that because senators acquitted a president they found him “ not guilty ” of what he was accused of doing . an acquittal by the senate could simply imply that they determined whatever he supposedly did didn ’ t merit removal from office . <PARA> in this case , even republicans didn ’ t really argue that trump hadn ’ t actually committed the acts that formed the basis of impeachment — they just argued that the dispute should have gone through the regular court system first , or that his behavior wasn ’ t a serious enough infraction to boot him from office . that ’ s another difference with the criminal justice system : in impeachment cases , you can ’ t charge someone with lesser crimes or impose a lesser sentence — it ’ s all or nothing . <PARA> impeachment is a historical rarity . only three presidents in <MASK> have been impeached by the house : trump , bill clinton in 1998 , and andrew johnson in 1868 . all were acquitted , meaning that never in the <MASK> of the united <MASK> has the senate voted to convict and remove a president from office . although richard nixon famously faced impeachment amid the watergate scandal , he resigned from office before he was impeached by the house .",2020-02-25 17:13:19+00:00,test_1052,test,misinfo

0,"this warning about the potential danger to pets posed by cocoa mulch began appearing in our inbox in may 2003 . <PARA> although there is at least some truth to this one , the dangers it warns about are by now somewhat outdated and exaggerated : most dogs aren ’ t really interested in eating cocoa mulch , some brands of that product have been reformulated to reduce or eliminate the potentially dog - dangerous substance it contains ( theobromine ), and we know of only one substantiated case of a pet death caused by ingestion of the substance . <PARA> ( in july 2007 , “ moose ,” a 3 - year - old labrador belonging to a minneapolis couple , died after eating cocoa mulch purchased at a local store . his owners had a veterinarian at the university of minnesota perform a necropsy to determine the likely cause of death of their young and previously healthy pet . the vet found cocoa shells in moose ’ s stomach and <MASK> of theobromine in the shells .) <PARA> cocoa mulch , made of cacao shells , is popular with gardeners and landscapers for a number of reasons : it has an aromatic scent , it repels garden pests , it retains moisture well , and it has a rich brown color that darkens ( rather than fades ) over time . however , veterinarians have warned pet owners that cacao shells also naturally contain theobromine , the same ingredient that makes chocolate toxic to dogs : <PARA> the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals ( aspca ) confirms the potential effects of theobromine and caffeine on dogs : <PARA> according to tables we ’ ve examined , cocoa mulch contains 300 - 1200 mg . of theobromine per ounce , making cocoa mulch one of the strongest concentrations of theobromine a pet is likely to encounter in any chocolate product . however , the question of the gravity of the risk presented by this type of gardening mulch remains a matter of debate . according to hershey ‘ s , for example : <PARA> and some of those who vend cocoa mulch note that although they ’ re aware of the pet warnings , they ’ ve never encountered a case of a dog ’ s being sickened by the product : <PARA> some manufacturers of cocoa mulch ( such as the cocoa mulch brand ) now <MASK> that their products are theobromine - free and pet safe . responsible pet owners should take care in their selection of cocoa mulch brands ; some might prefer to choose another form of soil enhancement for their gardens , such as cedar - based products , rather than gamble their dogs won ’ t be attracted to or harmed by cocoa mulch . <PARA> ( although home depot is named as a vendor of cocoa mulch in the example cited at the head of this page , the company told us in may 2006 that : “ the home depot does not and will not sell mulch harmful to pets . the mulch sold by the home depot containing cocoa shells goes through several cleaning processes , including a high heat system in order to strip the cocoa fat from the shells without the use of any chemicals .”) <PARA> the danger of canine theobromine poisoning does not begin and end with cocoa mulch , however : chocolate in any form poses substantial risks to some pets . this most beloved of foodstuffs contains theobromine and small amounts of caffeine , both of which can sicken and even kill cats and dogs . <PARA> chocolate ’ s toxicity to animals is directly related to three factors : the type of chocolate , the size of the animal , and the amount of chocolate ingested . unsweetened baking chocolate presents the greatest danger to pets because it contains the highest amount of theobromine , approximately 390 - 450 mg . per ounce . white chocolate contains the least . as a general rule of thumb , one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight can be lethal for dogs and cats . ( milk chocolate contains approximately 44 - 66 mg of theobromine per ounce .) <PARA> theobromine affects the heart , central nervous system , and kidneys , causing nausea and vomiting , restlessness , diarrhea , muscle tremors , and increased urination . cardiac arrhythmia and seizures are symptoms of more advanced poisoning . other than induced vomiting , vets have no treatment or antidote for theobromine poisoning . death can occur in 12 to 24 hours . <PARA> this type of poisoning is uncommon because it is rare that a dog , even a small dog , will eat enough chocolate to cause anything more than an upset stomach . yet it can happen , especially if the animal gets into baking chocolate or powdered cocoa , two forms of the sweet particularly loaded with theobromine . <PARA> do not feed chocolate to dogs or cats . if you keep a pet , do not leave chocolate lying about lest your critter help himself to it and in so doing poison himself . if your animal begins exhibiting signs of distress and you believe he might have gotten into some chocolate , call your veterinarian immediately . ( it will help if you can supply information about the approximate weight of your critter , what sort of chocolate was ingested — white , milk , dark , cocoa powder , baking — and roughly how much .) but time is of the essence if such a poisoning has indeed taken place , so make the call right away .",2003-05-25T07:00:00+00:00,dev_716,dev,info

1,"<MASK> : this item <PARA> is another case where someone has taken a genuine photograph and added a humorous ( but fictitious ) explanation to it . <PARA> picture comes from the fiesta de san fermín , a festival held every year between 6 july and 14 july in pamplona , spain , to commemorate san fermín , a 3rd - century saint who was martyred in being dragged through the streets of pamplona by bulls . one of the highlights of the festival — and the event most well - known to the rest of the world ( due in large part to its popularization through the writings of ernest hemingway ) — is the encierro , known in english as the “ running of the bulls .” <PARA> each day ’ s san fermín festivities include afternoon bullfights , and at 8 a . m . every morning the bulls to be used in that afternoon ’ s fights are set loose from a corral and herded about a half - mile through the cobbled streets of the town for a three - to four - minute run to the plaza de toros bullfighting stadium . many festival celebrants ( mostly young males ) choose to demonstrate their courage and physical prowess by donning white garb , tying red handkerchiefs about their necks , and running ahead of the group of charging bulls for as long as they can . others opt for somewhat safer ways to experience the thrill of participation : running only a very short portion of the course , running behind the bulls , standing in the street and ducking safely into doorways just as the bulls run past , or simply lining the streets for close - up views of the proceedings . ( most years at least a few participants end up being gored or otherwise injured during the encierro , and at least fourteen people have been killed since 1924 .) <PARA> the image shown above was taken by a photographer during the 2002 san fermín festival and distributed by the reuters news agency . according to a representative for reuters , the photographer who snapped this remarkable picture was not injured in any way .

1,"hi all : a bit of information that you might like to know about . we have friends here in our community and one of their sons is an entomologist ( insect expert ), and has been telling them that there is an epidemic of bed bugs now occurring in america . recently i have heard on the news that several stores in nyc have had to close due to bed bug problems , as well as a complete mall in new jersey . <PARA> he says that since much of our clothing , sheets , towels , etc . now comes from companies outside of america , ( sad but <MASK> ), even the most expensive stores sell foreign clothing from china , indonesia , etc . the bed bugs are coming in on the clothing as these countries do not consider them a problem . he recommends that if you buy any new clothing , even underware and socks , sheets , towels , etc . that you bring them into the house and put them in your clothes dryer for at least 20 minutes . the <PARA> heat will kill them and their eggs . do not purchase clothes and hang them in the closet first . it does not matter what the price range is of the clothing , or if the outfit comes from the most expensive store known in the u . s . they still get shipments from these countries and the bugs can come in a box of scarves or anything else for that matter . that is the reason why so many stores , many of them clothing stores have had to shut down in nyc and other places . all you need is to bring one item into the house that has bugs or eggs and you will go to hell and back trying to get rid of them . he travels all over the country as an advisor to many of these stores , as prevention and after they have the problem . <PARA> send this information on to those on your e - mail list so that this good prevention information gets around quickly . <PARA> <MASK> : this helpful heads - up about bedbug <MASK> began landing in the snopes . com inbox in early october 2010 . while it is <MASK> the u . s . is experiencing an explosion in its bedbug population , this phenomenon is not due to the critters ’ suddenly arriving on clothing manufactured in countries where their presence is winked at — the bedbug problem has been on the rise in the u . s . for years , with all 50 <MASK> reporting epidemic levels as far back as 2007 . the national pest management association ( npma ) has seen a 71 percent increase in bedbug <MASK> since 2001 , mainly due to international travel . bedbugs hitch rides on the luggage of people who travel ; the <MORE> as much as 45 minutes . <PARA> bedbugs are the ultimate hitchhikers , quickly taking up residence in suitcases and backpacks set down in infested areas . they are almost unimaginably hardy , capable of surviving for more than a year without eating ( which means a house that has sat empty for that length of time could still contain a bedbug population with the potential of driving its new homeowner mad ) and able to resist extremes of temperature , from freezing to 113 & deg ’ f . despite their name , bedbugs reside everywhere in any given room , not just in its bed . while their most common hiding spots are in the cracks and crevices of mattresses and box springs , they can also hide in furniture , baseboards , <PARA> electrical outlets , or any other small space or fabric surface near humans . <PARA> the process of eradicating bedbugs that have taken up residence in one ’ s home is a daunting one , generally involving three separate sessions of extermination , with each of those comprising a number of different methods . it ’ s lengthy , expensive , and frustrating , and if any of the bugs are missed , the bedbugs will be back in force in short order . <PARA> the best remedy is to not bring bedbugs into your home from other sites in the first place . when staying in hotels , place your bag on a suitcase stand rather than on the floor or the bed . bedbugs can ’ t easily climb metal , which means your bag and its contents should be relatively safe from them provided you place your valise on a metal - legged suitcase rack . keep the suitcase rack away from walls and any wooden furniture , thereby preventing the bugs easy access to your belongings . if your hotel room lacks this amenity , you might try leaving your bag in the bath tub . ( we ’ ve heard bedbugs can ’ t easily climb enamel .) consider keeping everything in your suitcase during your stay ( rather than unpacking its contents ) and keeping your bag encased in a thick plastic bag when not in immediate use . <PARA> at home , store luggage outside the domicile ( in a shed , for example ) to prevent any bedbugs that got onboard despite your precautions from entering your house . immediately wash all clothing you took on your travels , as opposed to letting them sit for a bit in the laundry basket . be wary of acquiring used furnishings , especially beds and couches . ( if you must take on such items , inspect them very carefully for signs of bedbug <MASK> .) run any second - hand clothing you ’ ve bought or been given through the dryer as soon as you bring it into the house . <PARA> barbara “ debugged ” mikkelson",2010-10-09T18:23:58+00:00,train_2551,train,misinfo

1,"in late june , 2019 , university of california - davis professor frank mitloehner tweeted the ingredient list of three food items , two of which were popular plant - based burgers and one of which was “ premium dog food ”: <PARA> the point , mitloehner later tweeted , was that the two most notable plant - based imitation burgers , impossible burgers and beyond meat burgers , were “ indistinguishable from dog food .” from a factual standpoint , the three images accurately depict ingredient lists for ( from left to right ) a beyond meat burger , “ walk about dog food ” brand “ super premium ” grain - free vegan dog food , and an impossible burger . <PARA> let ’ s get into the weeds : 10 of the ingredients ( taking some chemical liberties and ignoring entirely the relative amounts of each ) of the 20 listed for the impossible burger can also be found among the 28 in the vegan , grain - free dog food : <PARA> in the case of the beyond meat burger comparison , both use peas as their source for protein . indistinguishability is perhaps in the eye of the beholder , but significant differences do exist between the burger - ingredient lists and the dog - food lists . <PARA> a broader question , though , is what scientific point does such a comparison serve ? one could make a similar argument that the ingredients in high - quality , organic beef dog food are “ nearly indistinguishable ” from canned beef chili served in the supermarket , but such a comparison wouldn ’ t be all that illustrative . indeed , like the beyond meat burger and the vegan dog food , the chili and the beef dog food both use the same protein source . <PARA> we asked mitloehner , who studies chemical emissions from animal agricultural practices and who has served as an expert witness defending the agricultural industry in the u . s . congress , what scientific point he was illustrating with his tweet . via email , he told us his concerns were with how the plant - based burgers were marketed : <PARA> asked about his interest in the topic , mitloehner told us it stemmed from “ the many media requests i receive about plant - based products including several [ media appearences ] alongside [ impossible foods founder ] pat brown and [ beyond meat founder ] ethan brown and the many factually incorrect <MASK> they make about animal agriculture , which often otherwise go unchallenged in the media .” <PARA> the <MASK> conceit behind these plant - based burgers was one of sustainability : being able to produce something that tastes like meat using a process that could scale up and still be sustainable . as an example , this is why the impossible burger uses gmo yeast to produce a protein — heme — that could theoretically be produced by widespread soy cultivation . the amount of soy required to produce heme would not be sustainable in the long - run . ( beyond meat does not use gmo products and does not include the protein heme , which is touted as the key to impossible burger ’ s taste .) <PARA> these burgers are indeed often marketed as a healthy alternative to meat , and that assertion is a bit muddier . pound for pound , meatless burgers have comparable amounts of protein , and impossible burgers have the same ( or more ) vitamins , and minerals added , according to harvard medical school ’ s health blog : <PARA> on the negative side , these plant - based burgers also contain comparable , if not elevated , amounts of saturated fat , which can contribute to heart disease . additionally , mitloehner ’ s point about the level of processing in plant - based burgers is a valid one — many of the ingredients are heavily processed and appear to meet international standards for ultra - processed food — generally considered to come with a host of nutritional deficiencies . <PARA> in sum , there are shared chemicals in vegan dog food and plant - based burgers . in our view , two shared ingredients out of a combined 46 ( in the case of beyond meat ) or 10 shared ingredients out of a combined 48 ( in the case of the impossible burger ) do not meet the threshold for being “ indistinguishable ,” and as such we rank the <MASK> mostly <MASK> .",2019-08-16 22:01:07+00:00,test_336,test,misinfo

( samantha ’ s and darrin ’ s family members , his boss and the boss ’ wife , plus the neighbors , were all written as older characters — their only contemporary was cousin serena , a role also played by elizabeth montgomery .) whatever the <MASK> relative ages of the actors and actresses involved , common sense would suggest the thespians playing samantha and the two darrins should have outlived all those who ’ d acted in other adult roles in bewitched . yet they hadn ’ t , which fueled belief in the curse . <PARA> the first of the trio to go , york , ( who was 63 when he died ) expired of emphysema . initially , his death wasn ’ t viewed as untimely , given that he ’ d been ill for years : a back condition had forced his retirement from the show in 1969 , and a subsequent addiction to painkillers also took its toll . sargent ( who was 64 when he crossed over ) was felled by <MASK> cancer . montgomery ’ s death , however , caused those looking for the workings of dark forces to re - examine the deaths of the two actors who had played darrin stephens in the series . while montgomery had been 62 at the time of her death , she was widely thought to have been only 57 , which made her passing seem all the more untimely . <PARA> however , while according to our flawed understanding of what length of life any of us should expect , some individual deaths might be viewed as out of place . yet a study of what happened to each of the actors and actresses to play major parts in the series shows that even the “ untimely ” passings fall into a larger pattern of order . first , let ’ s look at which cast members died , when they expired , how old they were at the time of their passing , and how they went : <PARA> now , let ’ s look at the cast members still with us : <PARA> according to the national center for health <MASK> ( nchs ), the average life expectancy in the u . s . is just shy of 78 years ( 77 . 8 years , to be precise ). applying that bit of knowledge to the “ bewitched death curse ” <MASK> , of the 20 cast members the supposed hex could have felled , we see that nine expired before reaching 77 . 8 years of age , nine ( one of whom is still living ) survived past that benchmark , and two are as yet undetermined ( the two actresses who played tabitha , both of whom are still alive and in their 40s ). ergo , the “ curse ” operated roughly the same way <MASK> chance would have — half the target group died before achieving the average lifespan , and half lived past that mark . <PARA> finally , regarding the modes of exit ( cancer , heart attack , stroke , emphysema , alzheimer ’ s ), the list ’ s one surprise is that none of the deaths is the least bit unusual . you would think any curse worth calling itself such would include a decapitation or two , or at least one instance of someone being eaten by wolves . <PARA> barbara “ hex a gone ” mikkelson",2014-03-22T16:13:54+00:00,train_2717,train,misinfo

1,"the earliest instance of this author - unknown e - mail dates to september 1998 : <PARA> it echoes a 1978 country song by chris ledoux , titled “ silence on the line ,” a ballad about a man leaving the rodeo to rejoin his wife and kids on the farm but calling home to ask if he can bring a crippled friend with him . the “ friend ,” of course , is himself , and he instead chooses to head to mexico rather than return to colorado when the wife makes it clear she needs a man around the place who is fit to help her work the farm instead of being a drain on their resources . <PARA> the tale is even older than that , though — it served as the plot of an episode of television ’ s alfred hitchcock presents . in “ the return of the hero ” ( <MASK> air date 2 march 1958 ), french soldier andré asks his wealthy family by telephone from a café about bringing home his friend marcel , who he says both saved his life and lost a leg in the war . news of marcel ’ s infirmity prompts the family to explain that the injured friend “ wouldn ’ t fit in ” on the <MASK> and that andré should not bring him . andré concludes the call , then is seen striding away on his crutches , his pinned - up empty trouserleg wordlessly expressing the truth of the matter , that he and not his friend was the one now missing a leg . <PARA> the legend is best read as an illustrative tale rather than as something that actually happened . the combination of an unknown author and lack of checkable details within the work should convince anyone the tale is a parable , not an account of real events . it also echoes a <MASK> documented in existence during world war ii : <PARA> once again , a son who lost limbs in a war surprised his parents in person with the news rather than telling them ahead of time . though fifty years separate the two tales , they are related . <PARA> the 1940s <MASK> gave voice to concern over the welfare of the many sons and husbands sent to do battle overseas . were they well ? were they safe ? had a tragic fate befallen them ? news was hard to come by , and often loved ones didn ’ t hear anything of each other for months at a time . during those periods of no news , it was easy to believe the worst had happened . <PARA> the “ horrifying surprise ” element expressed the dread resident in those keeping the home fires burning : that bad news was coming and would prove an unimaginable jolt when it came . the <MASK> ’ s shock factor of the soldier ’ s dropping his <MORE> ’ s resources , whether that person were the cherished son or a stranger , thus the parents ’ reaction is born of a clear - eyed view of the potential burdens . yet the value they would place on their son ’ s well - being is far greater than what they would bestow on a stranger , and all should know that , including the son who thought to test them . yes , caring for him would be a burden . but a greater burden would be worrying about him from afar , something that would not be the case were he someone unknown to them . <PARA> this illustrative tale falls down badly due to its inconsistency . the son chooses not to tell his parents the truth about his situation , hoping to spare them unpleasant knowledge they needn ’ t know in light of his decision to make his own way in the world . yet a few weeks later , this same noble lad supposedly kills himself rather than risk imposing upon his parents . his concern for them is thus short - lived in that his suicide will not only leave them mourning a dead son , but will bring to light the very circumstances he was trying to shield them from in the first place — as well as stun them with guilt over the remembered conversation of their having turned away his “ friend .” in the space of a paragraph , the fictional lad has gone from being bravely protective to cutting a large swath of irreparable harm through the lives of his loved ones . <PARA> the e - mailed version featuring the noble son concludes with the following moralizing comments and a glurge of a poem : <PARA> poems in praise of friendship notwithstanding , the truth is our families and friends mean more to us than strangers do , so we make sacrifices for them that we will not consider making for acquaintances . the parents in the tale do not act in an egregiously selfish manner , nor would it be correct to presume their reaction to their son ’ s altered physical reality from their reluctance to shoulder the anticipated demands that life with an unknown - to - them amputee would surely bring . one would be measured with a far different yardstick than the other . <PARA> moreover , clear - eyed acknowledgement of the realities of a person ’ s physical limitations is not the same as a dismissal of that person as worth knowing , as the chiding comments included after the <MASK> would seem to indicate . one walks more slowly beside a friend who is limping — one neither maintains normal walking speed and pretends the limp does not exist , nor concludes the limper has been rendered unlovable by his infirmity . recognition does not equate to devaluation ; neither does willful blindness equate to compassion .",2001-09-12T10:03:03+00:00,train_3457,train,misinfo

( peanuts disrobed from their shells appear to be okay with most drivers , however .) <PARA> this especially odd superstition is <MASK> to have its roots in one of two open - cockpit racer wrecks that took place in 1937 . those who attempt to explain the belief say peanut shells were subsequently found in the cockpits of the drivers who died in those crashes or , alternatively , these shells were afterwards discovered embedded in the grilles of the death cars . <PARA> the first wreck happened on may 16 at pennsylvania ’ s langhorne speedway during the feature race on that day ’ s card . in an attempt to take over second place during the 50 - mile race , frank bailey swerved to avoid hitting a car driven by bud henderson , then crashed into the outer fence on which a number of spectators were seated . just scant moments before , henderson had hit two spectators who were attempting to cross the track to the infield . three spectators died in that melee , and four other persons were injured , including one driver , frank bailey . <PARA> the second multi - car crash of 1937 took place on september 27 during the 20th lap of the 25 - mile sweepstakes race at the <MASK> fair in nashville . while there is confusion about whether four or five cars were involved in this crash , there is no doubt about what happened or the result . the car in the lead ( which had lapped the one then in second place ) began skidding and collided with the machine beside it . two ( or three ) other vehicles , which had been close on the heels of the second - place car , rammed into the two cars piled up in front . only one person died in this mess , veteran dirt track racer howard ( howdy ) cox . no one other than the drivers involved in the wreck were injured ; unlike the accident at langhorne , no spectators were harmed . <PARA> news coverage of both accidents fails to mention anything about peanuts , either about their hulls being found in the cockpits of crashed cars , or intact peanuts being harvested from their grilles . <PARA> subsequent to these deadly events , a <MASK> that peanut husks had something to <MORE> “ vernon orenduff , the new jersey black - headed motor maniac , refuses to race should a peanut shell drop in his seat .” the caption under the photograph that headed the <MASK> read , “ if you want to make vern orenduff , above auto racer , mad at saturday ’ s auto races at the spartanburg fair , just get near his miller race car saturday with some peanuts .” <PARA> yet there is a tie to at least one of those 1937 accidents . vern orenduff ( of peanut - hating fame ) was one of the drivers involved in the 27 september 1937 crash in nashville in which howard cox was killed . <PARA> it ’ s possible this one driver ’ s personal superstition about peanuts and their shells was pointed to as the cause of the fatal 1937 accident in which he was involved , perhaps by someone ’ s afterwards remembering orenduff ’ s strong conviction about goobers bringing bad luck . were that the case , one man ’ s particular bugbear became magnified into an entire sport ’ s bête noire . <PARA> race car drivers are a superstitious bunch , which is not surprising given the capricious danger of the sport . so very little stands between drivers and death , with the smallest of errors or mechanical malfunctions serving to send cars flying off the track and those behind their wheels to eternal rest . charms and proscriptions have long been mankind ’ s way to attempt to ward off bad luck in perilous situations , which is why it ’ s unusual to find a race car driver who lacks at least one protective pre - race ritual , good luck piece , or deliberate avoidance of a specific item believed to be unlucky . <PARA> among nascar drivers of the 2000s , superstitions and rituals abound . some swear by using particular urinals just prior to a race , others will not carry a $ 10 bill on their persons , or attribute their continued safety to the wearing “ lucky ” underwear or socks or their practice of never touching $ 50 bills . still others eschew everything having to do with the number 13 , or swear by eating at a particular restaurant just before the daytona 500 , or by noshing on a bologna sandwich just before a race . <PARA> some superstitions are even weirder . just prior to a race , one of the co - owners of michael andretti ’ s car would dance in front of the vehicle while shaking a cigar at it . a driver of note of the 1930s swore by rubbing the head of a black person , <MASK> that it helped him set three world ’ s records . <PARA> the best known racing superstition is an aversion to green cars , which are said to be particularly accident prone , even homicidal .",2010-03-07T21:44:50+00:00,train_6661,train,misinfo

some flee violence or conflict from war - torn places like syria to seek asylum , while others are looking for better economic prospects . others still are victims of human trafficking or environmental crises that drive them from their home regions . the instability and general lawlessness in libya that currently prevails creates fertile ground for human smugglers , who pack people onto increasingly dangerous vessels . as many as 950 people are believed to have died in 2015 when one such vessel capsized . <PARA> ngos took on a high profile role in pulling people to safety after the italian navy shuttered a short - lived but successful rescue operation known as “ mare nostrum ” (“ our sea ” in latin ) that ran from october 2013 to october 2014 , but was cut due to lack of support from other european union countries . mare nostrum was initially launched in response to public outcry over a shipwreck that killed more than 300 people near the italian island of lampedusa in 2013 . when that program ended , aid agency msf — a 45 - year - old ngo that brings doctors and medical personnel to crisis areas — took up the mission along with frontex , which provided search and rescue resources ( but at a fraction of the budget of mare nostrum ). other aid groups also joined in . <PARA> msf spokeswoman sandra murillo told us : <PARA> as of the end of july , just over 100 , 000 people have arrived on european shores in 2017 , 94 , 802 of them in italy . in the same timeframe , 2 , 385 people died while making the journey , according to the international organization for migrants . in the most recent reported tragedy , a boat carrying two women and five children capsized off the turkish coast , killing all aboard . <PARA> we found no <MASK> to support the <MASK> that these ngos are involved in illicit smuggling or trafficking activities . although allegations has been leveled by critics that their presence encourages migrants to make the dangerous mediterranean crossing and italian authorities have at least twice investigated accusations of illegal activities , no concrete <MASK> has appeared . organizations like frontex and the united nations stress that the non - governmental organizations ’ role in saving lives is crucial .",2017-08-04T02:42:34+00:00,train_6548,train,misinfo

1,"the legend of denmark ’ s king christian x and his wearing of the yellow star is our most stirring example of non - violent opposition to evil : ordinary citizens ( following the example of a courageous leader ) defy their military overlords by selflessly putting themselves in harm ’ s way to prevent the persecution of a defenseless minority . if only more people exhibited such moral fortitude nowadays , we reason , the world would be a much better place . perhaps if more people had exhibited such moral courage back then , we think , the holocaust might never have happened . <PARA> although the danes did undertake heroic efforts to shelter their jews and help them escape from the nazis , there is no real - life example of the actions described by this legend . danish citizens never wore the yellow badge , nor did king christian ever threaten to don it himself . in fact , danish jews never wore the yellow badge either ( except for the few who were finally deported to concentration camps ), nor did german officials ever issue an order requiring danish jews to display it . <PARA> we will assume everyone is familiar with the systematic persecution of jews instituted in germany after adolph hitler became chancellor in 1933 , and the subsequent imposition of laws requiring jewish - owned shops to be identified as such with prominent signs ; passports and ration cards held by jews to be stamped with the letter ‘ j ’; and jewish concentration camp inmates to wear yellow - and - red six - pointed stars . ( surprisingly , it was not until late 1941 that the display on clothing of a yellow star of david with the word ‘ jude ’ printed on it by jews was mandated by law in germany .) denmark entered the tragic saga on the morning of 9 april 1940 , when german troops overran the country and an ultimatum was delivered : if denmark offered no resistance , germany would respect danish political independence . the danish government and monarch , with no real options , quickly capitulated , and the five - year long occupation of denmark began . <PARA> the occupied engaged in symbolic gestures of defiance against their occupiers , such as wearing four coins tied together with red and white ribbons in their buttonholes .

year - old little girls and boys .” conspiracy theorist alex jones described the episode as “ historic ” and his infowars web site called the arrest of robinson “ the beginning of the end for free speech in europe .” <PARA> these <MASK> are based on a wild misunderstanding of a very basic principle in the legal system of england and wales , and of other parts of the u . k . far from being a “ historic ” violation of due process , robinson was jailed because a court judged he had breached the terms of an existing suspended sentence for contempt of court by violating a set of reporting restrictions often placed on the news media and others in the united kingdom in order to protect the due process rights of defendants and prevent the collapse of trials , something that could jeopardize the conviction of potentially guilty and dangerous individuals . <PARA> the “ media blackout ” on the child sexual abuse trial referred to by naturalnews . com was not designed to “ protect muslim pedophiles ,” but rather to protect the integrity of the child sexual abuse trial itself , prevent a costly re - trial , and avoid witnesses having to go through the trauma of testifying in court again . <PARA> reporting restrictions such as those imposed in the child sexual abuse case in question are temporary , meaning that the news media can reveal previously - censored details after the trial has concluded . so robinson was not jailed for engaging in journalism , or for merely reporting on alleged criminality . he was jailed for violating a court order , breaching the terms of an existing suspended sentence , and potentially risking the collapse of an ongoing trial . <PARA> background <PARA> in may 2017 , robinson — the founder of the far - right , conspiracy - mongering english defence league , and whose real name is stephen yaxley - lennon — was arrested for <MORE> factual error — broadcast to a potentially huge audience — could have serious consequences in a criminal trial . during the course of the 75 -

1,"in january 2016 , nbc news medical contributor natalie azar reported a segment for the today show that highlighted six medical screenings that can purportedly be done at home . one of these screenings , the “ bad breath test ,” served as the <MASK> basis for a series of largely erroneous ( but viral ) health posts on dubious websites . we will collectively refer the <MASK> made based on this information as the “ spoon test .” <PARA> the “ breath ” part of the “ spoon test ” <PARA> the <MASK> test , as described by azar , relies on factual science , which suggests that odors in one ’ s breath can be indicative of systemic health issues : <PARA> the use of a spoon to test breath odor has long been used as a way to get a rough sense of a person ’ s own breath , which is normally not readily perceptible to the person creating the odor . the method , as an example , is described in a 1996 review paper in the journal of the american dental association : <PARA> placing the spoon under the light presumably serves to increase the odor causing potential of the material sampled by the spoon . the notion that some odors can be indicative of conditions outside of dental hygiene , as well , is not controversial . the today show writeup of the test links to an entry on the nih ’ s medline website that describes various causes of bad breath , including the items referenced in the test : <PARA> these facts ( while not controversial ) do not mean that such observations would have any diagnostic or screening value , because the conditions they describe would be so far progressed by the point that they would show up on your breath that you would already be well aware of serious health problems , or they would be caused by highly noticeable things like excessive vomiting or a tube in your throat . <PARA> joseph wolfsdorf , a professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school and director of the diabetes program at boston children ’ s hospital , told us that diabetic ketoacidosis would produce a fruity odor , but that this would be a sign of severe and pronounced illness that should already have produced more noticeable symptoms : <PARA> the case is the same for that fishy odor on the breath — there is a connection between kidney failure and ammonia - breath , but this would be an extremely late <MASK> of an already obvious and serious condition . <PARA> we reached out to azar multiple times through multiple channels to get more information on the scientific rationale behind her test , but have not yet received a response . <PARA> the “ stain ” portion of the “ spoon test ” <PARA> perhaps as a result of the lackluster utility of the test as <MASK> described , <MORE> builds up , causing a yellow tint in palmar and plantar surfaces .” <PARA> while medical literature does support the notion that a buildup of carotene caused by hypothyroidism may result in a yellowish discoloration on the palms of the hands ( palmar surfaces ) or feet ( plantar surfaces ), it is unclear why this information has been re - interpreted as applicable to the tongue , especially when a yellow tongue discoloration is a common ( and usually benign ) symptom related to a variety of non - thyroid issues . <PARA> such a discoloration could also occur , wolfe <MASK> three bullet points down with a similar lack of <MASK> , as a result of kidney diseases through the same dubious “ carotenoid buildup ” mechanism . in other words , a yellow tongue on its own , even by the incorrect logic presented in wolfe ’ s post , tells you next to nothing . <PARA> in support of the <MASK> that purple stains could be indicative of “ poor blood circulation ” or “ high cholesterol levels ,” wolfe linked to a post by the daily mail which provided the commentary of naturopaths and traditional chinese herbalists ( again , with no supporting <MASK> or links ) about what various colors on the tongue might mean . there is no hard <MASK> to support a purple tongue ( let alone a purple stain on a spoon caused by a purple tongue ) as being indicative of poor blood circulation or high cholesterol levels . chronic bronchitis , similar to <MASK> made of breath odor , would be readily apparent to the sufferer without the use of a tongue test . <PARA> if the spoon produces white stains , wolfe says , you may be suffering from a respiratory infection .

1,"as is the case for many western democracies , the canadian government ’ s formal efforts to help refugees settle in the country have been the subject of much speculation , criticism and misinformation in recent years . in the fall of 2017 , a viral facebook post spread yet more misinformation about the benefits received by refugees in canada . <PARA> on 1 september 2017 , facebook user mike marcoux posted what appears to be a photograph of an itemized breakdown of benefits associated with the resettlement assistance program , along with the message : “ this is what 1 illegal refugee gets with the federal assistance program $ 3874 per month .” <PARA> we have modified the image to obscure the name of the recipient , which was included in the <MASK> photograph : <PARA> although this document appears to be authentic , according to the canadian council for refugees , a national nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and advocating for refugees , its representation on facebook was highly misleading : the document details payments to a family of five ( not a single person ) who were refugees accepted by canada ( and therefore are not in the country “ illegally ”), and most of the listed payments are one - time only resettlement assistance payments and not monthly benefits . <PARA> a spokesperson for the council told us the document showed “ a start up breakdown of costs for a newly arrived government - assisted refugee ( gar ) family ” and that the amounts shown were consistent with benefit rates in the province of british columbia . <PARA> despite the apparent authenticity of the document , marcoux ’ s post grossly misrepresents the contents . <PARA> firstly , contrary to mike marcoux ’ s post , there is no such thing as an “ illegal ” refugee in this context . by definition , beneficiaries of the canadian government ’ s resettlement assistance program are individuals and families formally recognized by the canadian government as refugees before they travel to canada . according to the canadian council for refugees , government - assisted refugees such as those to whom this document appears to relate are “ referred by the [ u . n . high commissioner for refugees ] to canada because they have been identified as being in need of resettlement .” <PARA> secondly , the document does not relate to one refugee , as the facebook post <MASK> <MASK> . the document clearly shows that these benefits are for a family of five people : <PARA> third , the grand total value of the benefits ($ 3 , 874 cad or $ 2 , 748 usd as of 28 january 2016 ) is not a recurring monthly payment , as the facebook post <MASK> <MASK> . <PARA> the document clearly shows that the majority of benefits listed are one - off “ start - up ” benefits . the only regular monthly benefits are conveniently labelled “ regular monthly benefits ,” and consist of payments for food , rent and transportation , which , because of the size of the family , total $ 1 , 399 cad per month ($ 1 , 094 usd as of 15 november 2017 ). <PARA> these monthly benefits work out to $ 16 , 788 cad ($ 13 , 132 usd ) a year for a family of five ( in addition to “ start - up ” benefits ). unless there are exceptional circumstances , these resettlement assistance program benefits are only payable to refugees for one year . <PARA> the amounts of benefits depend on the size of the family that receives them . if this document did relate to a single individual ( as the facebook post <MASK> ), the overall monthly payments could be expected to be significantly lower . <PARA> the one - off start - up benefits which bring the total in this particular document to $ 3 , 874 also include a $ 375 loan for a security deposit for housing . being a loan , that amount will have to be repaid to the federal government . <PARA> furthermore , depending on when this particular family arrived in canada , they may be required to pay the canadian government for the cost of their transportation into the country , which takes the form of loan debt . according to the canadian council for refugees , the average loan debt between 2008 and 2012 was $ 3 , 090 cad . <PARA> so while the document in the photograph does appear to be authentic , mike marcoux ’ s facebook post constitutes a gross misrepresentation of what ’ s actually in it . <PARA> the same document formed the basis of a similarly - outraged post on the right - wing blog “ 90 miles from tyranny ” in december 2016 . that blog post cited an earlier <MASK> by the now - defunct magafeed web site , which is listed in the fake news codex as a “ clickbait site with misleading , poorly [ sourced ], and outright <MASK> stories .” <PARA> it ’ s hardly the first time that canada ’ s refugee policy has been the subject of <MASK> <MASK> . for example , a factual error in a 2004 letter to the editor of the toronto star spawned a chain email and online memes <MASK> <MASK> that refugees in canada receive more benefits each month than do canadian pensioners . the <MASK> persisted for years . <PARA> similar <MASK> <MASK> have been spread in the country ’ s southern neighbor , the united <MASK> , often with the headline “ insanity is when illegal refugees get $ 3 , 874 a month in federal assistance while social security checks average $ 1 , 200 a month .”",2017-11-15T23:33:18+00:00,test_436,test,misinfo

1,"of all the “ low - level employee provides a simple yet brilliant innovation that increases the profits of a successful company many times over ” legends , one legend about how coca - cola came to be served in bottles rather than solely dispensed from fountains is without question the best known : <PARA> akin to the “ carbonated by mistake ” legend , this tale postulates that at least some of coca - cola ’ s remarkable success was the result of dumb luck rather than intelligent business design . just as the “ accidental carbonation ” chestnut hypothesizes that if it hadn ’ t been for an addlepated soda jerk the beverage would always have lacked fizz , this <MASK> about a stranger who fortuitously turned up with a million - dollar idea advances the notion that coca - cola wouldn ’ t otherwise have been vended in bottles . <PARA> while it is difficult to pin down precisely when the idea of selling coke in bottled form was first kited , we can tell it occurred near the product ’ s 1885 debut thanks to one of the participant ’ s memories about a dispute over the notion . sam dobbs , nephew of asa candler ( who bought up the rights to coca - cola in 1888 ), got himself in trouble with his uncle by secretly vending bottles of the soft drink syrup to entrepreneurs manning back - alley bottling machines . <PARA> but candler ’ s objections were not based on a failure to comprehend the potential sales value of providing the buying public with the beverage in bottled fashion ; rather , they sprang from then - reasonable concerns about unsanitary bottling conditions adulterating the drink and injuring the product ’ s standing . “ there are too many folks [ bottlers ] who are not responsible , who care nothing about the reputation of what they put up , and i am afraid the name [ of coca - cola ] will be injured ,” he said . <PARA> ergo , legend to the contrary , asa candler ( who was coca - cola back in those early days ) gained the “ bottle it ” advice not from a mysterious stranger who struck a hard bargain in exchange for the intelligence , but for free from his go - getter of a teenage nephew . candler chose not to immediately implement the suggestion , though , which perhaps contributes to belief in the legend . <PARA> the fact that coca - cola was not widely available in bottled form until well after it was established as a fountain drink does not reflect , as legend would have it , the coca - cola company ’ s lack of awareness of the potential market for bottled drinks , but instead was a product of coca - cola ’ s recognition that the bottling process at that time was notoriously difficult , <MORE> 1915 , a variety of straight - sided bottles were used .) the stoppered hutchinson bottles were exceedingly difficult to clean ( in those days , bottles were washed and re - used rather than filled once and discarded when empty ), an additional fact that serves to make candler ’ s reluctance to bottle the product a bit more understandable . <PARA> joe biedenharn of vicksburg , mississippi , was one of the soda ’ s earliest bottlers . he went from peddling coke syrup to druggists for the company to , in 1894 , bottling and then selling the carbonated beverage itself . another early bottler was the valdosta bottling works of valdosta , georgia , which began putting up coke in bottles in 1897 . <PARA> the legend attached to how coca - cola came to be bottled is indeed an old one . in the 1934 film imitation of life , a bum whom beatrice ‘ bea ’ pullman ( claudette colbert ) feeds a free breakfast of pancakes announces by way of negotiating another helping of food that he will tell beatrice “ in two words how to make a million dollars .” before offering his simple - yet - brilliant suggestion about a way to transform pullman from a mere café owner into a pancake mogul , he regales her with the tale of an unnamed fellow who once approached the president of coca - cola with a similar proposition , saying , “ for $ 100 , 000 , i ’ ll tell you how to make millions .” but of course the advice of the unnamed fellow was “ bottle it .” <PARA> the legend didn ’ t begin with that <MASK> film , though , because mention of it appears in a 1935 note penned by new yorker editor harold ross . ross was in the habit of typing out idea sheets ( <MASK> suggestions ) for potential “ talk of the town ” pieces , and his 23 september 1935 entry reads as follows : <PARA> notice that even in 1935 ross referred to the <MASK> as a legend he ’ d been hearing for years , so while that note was dated a year after the release of imitation of life , the knowledge behind it predated the film . ross ’ s note also evinced a surely modern version of the legend : in 1896 the coca - cola company ’ s entire surplus amounted to less than $ 50 , 000 — to have thrown all that cash at a stranger in exchange for nothing more than the nebulous promise of a “ great idea ” would have been madness indeed . <PARA> it may never prove possible to isolate the <MASK> of this well - traveled innovation tale , but we can say with great assurance that it entered the canon of popular lore long before the majority of our readers came into the world .",2005-10-11T00:03:34+00:00,train_6695,train,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : a common facet of collegiate life are conjectures that position one ’ s school as in some way distinct from or better than all others , conjectures that come to be believed by the young people who <PARA> attend those institutions . such tales bestow ( at least in the minds of the students ) certain bragging rights and thus tend to be embraced as fact rather than questioned . <PARA> “ my school is special because ...” <MASK> tend to concentrate on physical aspects of the campus ( e . g ., that certain buildings were through an architect ’ s blunder built backwards or that particular items of <MASK> will do strange things when a virgin walks by , or that a dorm is haunted by the ghost of a co - ed who killed herself or was murdered there ) or posturings about the proclivities of the student body ( e . g ., that the particular college being boasted about was at one time named playboy ’ s top party school ). <PARA> the particular collegiate belief that forms the topic of this <MASK> is a bit of an exception to the norm because it advances the <MASK> that the institutions of higher learning in question are special not because of something physically or historically part of any one of them , but through their having been ennobled in a popular cartoon that has become a cult favorite among collegians . according to cherished belief , each of the main characters in scooby - doo represents one of the schools known collectively as the five colleges : amherst , hampshire , mount holyoke , smith , and university of massachusetts amherst ( also known as umass ). the explanation for this phenomenon is generally attributed to the show ’ s creator being an alumnus of one of those schools , usually umass . <PARA> with almost no variation , the cartoon characters and colleges are matched up this way : <PARA> whose students are represented in this tableau as polished , upper - class young ladies more interested in acquiring rich husbands than university sheepskins . <PARA> whether the above stereotypes fit the studential norm of these schools is a subjective issue . what is objectively answerable , however , is how the scooby - doo series came about , an evolution of a concept that puts paid to the notion that the five familiar characters are representations of what somebody regarded as the typical student attending each of the five colleges . <PARA> in response to criticism that saturday morning children ’ s offerings contained too much violence , a number of new cartoons were developed in the late 1960s , including the archie show . the <MASK> concept of what was to become scooby - doo , where are you ? was of a five - teen musical group touring the countryside and becoming embroiled in mysteries wherever they stopped , a <MORE> soon fell by the wayside , giving way to a new series title : who ’ s scared ? the five teens had become four : geoff and mike were melded into the composite character ronnie ( later rechristened freddie jones as an homage to fred silverman , then director of daytime programs at cbs - tv ), kelly was renamed daphne blake , linda was redubbed velma dinkley , and w . w . was given the new name of norville “ shaggy ” rogers . the former linda and w . w . ( now velma and shaggy ) were no longer sister and brother . <PARA> that iteration was judged by network executives as too scary for its intended audience of youngsters , so the show ’ s concept was consequently retooled : the rock band idea was dropped , and the focus of the show shifted to highlight comic interactions between the characters and to play down its more frightening aspects . in particular , the characters of shaggy and too much were brought into the forefront to reposition the show as a comedy . the dog was rechristened scooby - doo by fred silverman , who came up with the name upon listening to the vocal improvisation at the end of frank sinatra ’ s strangers in the night : “ scooby dooby doo ...” <PARA> scooby - doo , where are you ? premiered on cbs in 1969 . the series aired in various forms first on cbs and then on abc until 1991 , making it the longest continually running cartoon series in television <MASK> . the <MASK> cast had record - spinner casey kasem voicing the character of shaggy . ( don messick was scooby - doo , frank welker was fred , nicole jaffe was velma , and stefanianna christopherson was daphne .) <PARA> if all of the above seems a bit hard to wade through , i offer what it boils down to : the scooby - doo gang were not conceived as representations of typical students of particular colleges — instead , its four human members were <MASK> modeled on corresponding characters from the 1960s tv show the many loves of dobie gillis , and the canine character was elevated from a non - speaking bongo - playing pet into the star of the show when the focus of the cartoon shifted to place greater emphasis on comedy . the five characters now so well known did not spring into being fully formed ; they instead evolved throughout the behind - the - scenes development process . <PARA> alternatively , consider this : hampshire college did not open until 1970 , a year after scooby - doo , where are you ? hit the airwaves . <PARA> obligatory strange scooby fact : the gang is 84 % more likely to stumble upon a secret passage than to find it intentionally . <PARA> barbara “ passage err pigeons ” mikkelson",2010-04-28T06:43:58+00:00,test_180,test,misinfo

1,"in late april 2017 , multiple web sites reported that the <MASK> of alabama had just returned the u . s . to the racially divisive pre - brown v . board of education era and once again brought upon the country the specter of legally segregated schools : <PARA> although u . s . district court judge madeline haikala ruled that a predominantly white city could form their own school district ( despite her finding that their motivations for initiating the process were racially biased ), her decision didn ’ t actually “ bring back segregation .” her ruling only allows the city of gardendale , alabama , to separate from the jefferson county schools district if over the course of three years they meet requirements laid out by the court , submit a desegregation plan , and appoint at least one african - american board member . <PARA> on 13 february 2018 , a federal appeals court blocked gardendale from moving forward with its secession , agreeing with haikala ’ s finding its plan to do so was racially motivated . gardendale plans to appeal that decision . <PARA> federal law prohibits institutional segregation in schools , and haikala is presiding over a 1971 desegregation order resulting from the stout vs . jefferson county board of education ruling , which requires federal oversight of all jefferson county schools to ensure compliance with that order : <PARA> on 24 april 2017 , judge haikala ( an appointee of president trump ’ s predecessor , barack obama ) ruled that she found racial motives for efforts by residents of the predominantly white city of gardendale to take over four schools within their municipal boundaries and separate from jefferson county , a diverse public school district . residents and newly formed gardendale school district officials actively recruited students from neighboring mount olive , which is also predominantly white , and complained about children from racially mixed or majority african - american communities such as center point and north smithfield being bused into schools in gardendale : <PARA> the gardendale education board wanted to take four schools , gardendale elementary , snow rogers elementary , bragg middle school and gardendale high school , which are all predominantly white and would become more so over time , because the gardendale education board would eventually stop allowing students from outside the newly formed district to attend without paying tuition . the students ’ families would also be required to find their own transportation if they wanted to attend a gardendale school . <PARA> according to court documents , gardendale high is a <MASK> - of - the - art school that was built with jefferson county tax dollars . although gardendale planned to fold the high school into their new system at no cost to itself , jefferson county would have had to pay $ 55 million to construct a replacement facility . haikala ’ s ruling prevents gardendale from taking the high school without compensating the county or relinquishing the school to the county , under which it would operate with a new name . <PARA> haikala ’ s ruling initially provides the new district with only two elementary schools and allows secession from jefferson county only if conditions overseen by the court are met over the course of three years . she held that although their efforts to secede were motivated by race , the rights of parents who simply wanted greater and more local control of their children ’ s education must be considered , citing concerns that african - american children currently attending school in gardendale would bear the brunt of resentment from their white peers if they were seen as the cause of a failed separation effort . <PARA> judge haikala had ordered nine conditions be met in order for gardendale to separate : <PARA> u . w . clemon , a retired federal judge who represents african - american plaintiffs in the 52 - year - old stout case filed a motion on 1 may 2017 asking haikala to reconsider her ruling , arguing that it runs contrary to long - standing efforts bring schools into alignment with the desegregation order . clemon has also sought an injunction blocking gardendale from moving forward on the ruling and taking steps to establish a separate school district while the motion is being considered by the court : <PARA> we reached out to the department of justice , but a spokesman there said the department had no comment on the matter .",2017-05-05T01:31:59+00:00,train_5554,train,misinfo

1,"in 1969 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) began collecting nationwide data on the numbers of abortions , the abortion ratio ( abortions versus live births ), and the abortion rate ( abortions versus the us population of women aged 15 - 44 years old ). <PARA> while these data are not perfect due to inconsistent ( and sometimes non - existent ) reporting from different <MASK> , they can be used to analyze relative changes in abortion rates during the presidencies of different presidential parties , as we will do here using numbers from the cdc ’ s annual abortion surveillance study . red portions of the lines show the ratio and rates of abortions occurring under republican administrations , and blue under democratic administrations : <PARA> before delving into the specific relationship between abortions and the political party affiliation of the president , the complete data set should be analyzed as a whole to provide context . this is how the cdc describes the overall trend in their data : <PARA> the large uptick in legal abortions though the ’ 70s is related to the the landmark 1973 roe v . wade decision , in which the united <MASK> supreme court ruled that a woman ’ s right to an abortion is protected under the right to privacy of the due process clause of the 14th amendment . <PARA> it is plain to see that abortion rates have risen ( prior to their peaking in the mid - 1980s ) and fallen under both democratic and republican administration , suggesting little to no correlation with whichever political party controls the white house . the overall trend since the 1980s has been a fairly consistent decline across through administrations of both parties . <PARA> it would be easy to demonstrate that abortion rates have not risen under democratic administrations in the last several decades , but it would be <MASK> to argue that declines in abortion rates are an exclusive feature of democratic presidencies . the <MASK> that abortion rates fall under democrats , while <MASK> , ignores the fact that rates have also continued to decline through republican administrations as well . <PARA> the <MASK> , then , that abortion rates ( at least since their mid - 1980s peak ) have risen when republicans have held the white house is therefore equally <MASK> . at most , one can argue that the rate of decline appeared to slow during the presidency of george w . bush before increasing under president barack obama ’ s administration , but such an observation would be based on a comparison between only two administrations and would do nothing to demonstrate causation . <PARA> in fact , causation between the presidency and abortion rates would be difficult to demonstrate in any case because it is hard to draw a straight line between federal government policy ( let alone presidential policy ) and abortion procurement . nearly all challenges to open access to abortion have come at the <MASK> , and not the federal , level . according to a 2013 report by the pro - choice guttmacher institute : <PARA> at the federal level , legislators have had more trouble passing abortion restrictions into law , making it difficult to argue that any presidential policy , specifically , has had an effect on abortion rates . the only relevant federal legislation that has been signed into law are the 1976 hyde amendment , which prohibited federal money from funding ( most ) abortions , and the partial - birth abortion ban act of 2003 , which criminalized abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy and was upheld as constitutional by the supreme court in 2007 . <PARA> what one can say , though , is that federal or myriad <MASK> - level regulations put in place do not appear to produce much of a change in abortion rates , according to a 2014 study by the guttmacher institute : <PARA> according to the cdc , multiple factors can affect abortion rates , including those such as contraception and demographic changes that have an effect on the demand for ( as opposed to availability of ) abortions :",2016-11-11T23:47:27+00:00,test_544,test,misinfo

1,"to “ let the cat out of the bag ” is one of those sayings wherein meaning is instinctively grasped even if it ’ s difficult to coherently put into words why this is so . while this phrase is a widespread shortform for truth coming to light , there is nothing obvious about why a cat ’ s being released from a sack should have anything to do with a secret ’ s being revealed . ( even so , it ’ s a handy phrase to have in one ’ s linguistic arsenal , in that there ’ s no one word in the english language that conveys the revelation , deliberate or accidental , of information that was intended to be kept hush - hush .) <PARA> the most widely believed theory about the saying ’ s <MASK> asserts it has to do with chicanery practiced upon those purchasing livestock . according to its lights , unscrupulous sellers of pigs would hastily swap a cat for the porker that had been purchased and bagged for easier transport when the buyer looked away for a moment , with the duped purchaser discovering the substitution only upon returning home and letting the cat out of the bag . <PARA> although numerous etymology books tout this explanation as the phrase ’ s <MASK> , common sense should serve to dismiss it . for the duped livestock purchaser theory to be right , the seller ’ s deception would come to light only when the cat was let out of the bag . yet , bag or not , it ’ s nigh on impossible to mistake a cat for a pig . at very least , anyone this deception was tried upon would quickly conclude there was something mighty wrong about its porker long before he opened the bag to see what was going on inside . <PARA> housecats and pigs are not of comparable size , so a sack containing the one instead of the other isn ’ t going to fool a buyer , in that the filled bag is going to be a fair bit smaller than it was before the sleight of hand . even if a large cat were shoved into the bag in place of a rather small pig , due to the nature of the build of each of these types of critters , the weight is going to be badly off — since cats are rather loosely constructed compared to far more densely - fleshed pigs , the cat is going to weigh far less than the porker even when both animals are the same size . <PARA> cats also behave far differently than pigs . while a pig encased in a sack might squeal or oink as it ’ s carried home , a cat is going to spit , yowl , hiss , and meow . we think you ’ d have to search high and low to find anyone <MORE> the cat out of the bag ” to have as its <MASK> a practice of cats being surreptitiously foisted upon the unwary as pigs by crooked farmers , said fraud would have had to have been successfully run on so many that its denouement worked its way into the language ( and that via folks not figuring out they ’ d been had until they got home ). there weren ’ t that many fools in the middle ages : if there had been , the species wouldn ’ t have survived . <PARA> we suspect the duped livestock purchaser explanation was borrowed from the admonishment about not buying a pig in a poke , a saying that reliably dates to 1555 ( with its antecedent “ when a pig is offered , open the poke ” dating to 1325 ). that homily cautions against buying goods one has not examined ( as opposed to afterwards checking goods already examined and purchased to assure no one has covertly exchanged them for less valuable commodities ). <PARA> a second theory ascribes the <MASK> of the saying to the british royal navy , asserting the instrument of punishment used upon those errant in their duties or behaviors ( a whip called the ‘ cat of nine tails ’ or ‘ cat - o ’- nine - tails ’) was routinely kept in a red sack , thereby a sailor who brought to light the transgressions of another was “ letting the cat out of the bag .” however , no <MASK> documents that such whips were commonly stored in sacks , or that the phrase “ let the cat out of the bag ” was initially associated with maritime <MASK> or usage . <PARA> as to where the saying did come from , there is as yet no clear answer . possibly “ letting the cat out of the bag ” was always meant as no more than an entertaining mental image of the explosiveness of a confidence ’ s revelation — usually what is deliberately concealed is of a salacious or titillating nature , thus there are often huge elements of shock and surprise when the truth comes out , somewhat akin to the commotion raised by a frightened cat suddenly loosed from the bag that had imprisoned it . or it could have to do with a similarity between the behavior of both secrets and cats — once either is let out , they go wherever they want . ( in other words , private news that has been made public spreads far and wide , despite all efforts to keep it contained to a small circle of confidantes or even to silence it altogether .) or it could be that “ let the cat out of the bag ” was a line from a play now lost to us wherein the connection between moggies and sacks and secrets was all made clear to the audiences enthralled by it .",2010-08-08T12:05:00+00:00,dev_668,dev,misinfo

1,"on 1 february 2017 , erin elizabeth of “ health nut news ” published an <MASK> bearing the headline “ infant twins die simultaneously after vaccines , medical board rules ‘ just a coincidence ’” that implied the simultaneous death of infant twins was caused by childhood vaccinations : <PARA> elizabeth ’ s <MASK> was a highly deceptive one that deliberately omitted a wealth of contrary information in order to further her anti - vaccination agenda , starting with the fact that nowhere did she inform her readers that the report she was referencing was ten years old ( 2007 ), and that the infant deaths it examined occurred nearly fifteen years ago ( 2002 ). instead , she left readers with the misleading impression that she was describing a recent event and suggested that it was somehow suspicious that the non - homicide deaths of two infants in a remote part of the world fifteen years ago didn ’ t garner the attention of the u . s . national press — likely because doing so served to further the anti - vaccination narrative that the “ mainstream media ” is withholding the truth about the dangers of childhood vaccinations . <PARA> the incidence of two infant twin siblings dying within 24 hours of each other two days after receiving vaccines is factual . the information elizabeth cited was <MASK> published as a conference presentation and later as a case report in the journal of forensic and legal medicine . ( pubmed is a government repository of published journal abstracts , and as such does not “ report ” anything on their own .) this event was described in that report as follows : <PARA> the purpose of that report was to present the totality of information doctors and turkish government officials had available to them to prior to making a ruling on the cause of death , the main objective of which was to determine if any <MASK> of criminal wrongdoing existed . <PARA> a team of doctors , technicians , and judicial investigations did not find any clear cause for the deaths , so the case was referred to the turkish ministry of justice ’ s forensic medicine division , who ruled that the best available diagnosis was sudden infant death syndrome ( sids ): <PARA> elizabeth makes it clear that she believes the two died as a result of their vaccinations , an assessment based on no <MASK> whatsoever other than the temporal proximity of the twins ’ deaths to their vaccinations ( a classic expression of the post hoc , ergo propter hoc logical fallacy ). anti - vaccine advocates commonly try to draw a line between sids and vaccinations , but citing a temporal relationship alone is not convincing <MASK> of any link , since by definition the time period during which a death can be considered to be the result of sids generally corresponds to the same time period when children receive a <MORE> based study published in 2015 that used death - after - vaccination reports from 1997 through 2013 documented ( similar to the 2001 study ) a continued decline in deaths from sids in the united <MASK> and , once again , no correlation between vaccination and sids : <PARA> despite elizabeth ’ s derision at the use of the term “ coincidence ,” it should be noted that given the high numbers of children vaccinated in the world , an infant death occurring 24 - 48 hours after a vaccination by chance alone — in small numbers — is highly probable on an annual basis . a 2005 study published in the journal pediatrics investigated this question for the population of australian children and found that : <PARA> that the specific infant death event discussed here involved two simultaneous cases of sids , of course , makes that turkish tragedy more rare — but not quite as rare of elizabeth suggests . that ’ s because the probability of sids is higher for twins in general , and much higher for an infant whose twin sibling has been a victim of sids , as noted in the case report : <PARA> avoiding any mention of these significant factors was not the most egregious omission elizabeth made in her <MASK> , however . that award goes to her neglecting to mention the mother ’ s family <MASK> of sids , also described in the case report : <PARA> although samples were collected to test this line of inquiry , the turkish government did not pursue it due to a lack of facilities and cost . this factor , the researchers argued , was the largest limitation to their study ( and study limitations are typically a factor mentioned in objective coverage of scientific papers ). <PARA> we reached out to elizabeth to inquire whether she had read this portion of the paper ( or anything more than its abstract ), and if so , what her thoughts were on the probability of genetic mechanisms ( rather than vaccinations ) being responsible for the infants ’ deaths . a response from her “ part - time assistant ” <MASK> “ erin has read the entire paper ” but provided no further comment . <PARA> elizabeth did an impressive job of reporting a misleadingly minimum amount of factual information about a tragic event in an effort to support <MASK> of a link between vaccinations and sids — <MASK> that have been repeatedly rejected ( and rejected and rejected and rejected and rejected and rejected ) by the scientific community . <PARA> elizabeth attempted to advance her biased viewpoint not by offering <MASK> data or overt lies , but by the deliberate omission of any information — genetic <MASK> , the time and location of the event , the relationship between twinning and sids , and the massive body of research addressing the subject — contrary to her preferred anti - vaccination narrative .",2017-03-15T18:17:49+00:00,train_5560,train,misinfo

1,"president donald trump ’ s short trip to the united kingdom in july 2018 was accompanied by by protests , political intrigue , and typically intense scrutiny of his demeanor and actions , in particular during his meeting with queen elizabeth on 13 july . <PARA> one theory to emerge after the visit was that the queen had issued a coded , symbolic rebuke to trump by wearing a brooch that had been gifted to her by trump ’ s predecessor , former u . s . president barack obama . <PARA> the huffington post asked , for example , “ did queen elizabeth , the 92 - year - old monarch of the united kingdom , throw some subtle shade at president donald trump during his recent u . k . visit ?” explaining that : <PARA> vanity fair elaborated on that subject as follows : <PARA> the new york post ran with the misleading headline “ queen elizabeth wore gift from obama during trump meeting ,” which the <MASK> itself quickly contradicted by explaining that the queen had worn the “ obama brooch ” on the day trump arrived in the uk , but the “ george vi ” brooch during her actual meeting with the u . s . first couple . <PARA> so headlines such as the new york post ‘ s and the daily caller ‘ s , <MASK> that elizabeth ii wore a brooch gifted by the obamas during her meeting with the trumps , are <MASK> . <PARA> more broadly , we can ’ t intuit the motivations behind the british monarch ’ s fashion choices either in general or in these specific cases . the entire “ brooch theory ” is based on the premise that queen elizabeth personally doesn ’ t like president trump and is tacitly signaling her dislike to the public , but no concrete <MASK> supports that assumption . <PARA> with that theory in mind , we ’ re going to briefly examine the items worn by queen elizabeth on the three days of president trump ’ s visit to the u . k . and scrutinize the <MASK> rationale behind the “ brooch warfare ” theory . <PARA> queen elizabeth ’ s jewelry choices are regularly tracked on a blog called “ from her majesty ’ s jewel vault ,” and the brooch theory was most prominently expounded and promoted on twitter by a user with the handle samuraiknitter . <PARA> day one — 12 july 2018 <PARA> trump arrived in the u . k . but did not meet queen elizabeth . at windsor castle , the queen hosted the archbishop of canterbury , justin welby , and ahmad al - tayeb , a leading sunni muslim cleric and high imam of al - azhar in egypt . <PARA> according to “ from her majesty ’ s jewel vault ,” on that day queen elizabeth wore a brooch given to her by the obamas during their <MORE> that by choosing to wear a brooch given to her by canada ’ s governor - general , on a day when president trump was still physically present in the u . k ., elizabeth ii ( who is queen of the united kingdom and commonwealth countries , not merely england , as samuraiknitter <MASK> <MASK> ) was expressing solidarity with canada as a sideways dig at the u . s . president , who has recently been strongly critical of canadian prime minister justin trudeau . <PARA> this might be <MASK> , or the queen might simply have chosen a sapphire brooch to match the blue color in her dress , or picked that particular brooch because it had been almost exactly a year since she was presented with it . <PARA> the second strand to the theory is that queen elizabeth may have deployed an ironic subversion of the term “ snowflake ,” a derogatory word typically used online by right - wing commentators to describe liberal adversaries , by choosing a piece of jewelry called the sapphire jubilee snowflake brooch . <PARA> samuraiknitter outlined this second part of the theory in another series of tweets : <PARA> this argument is a good example of circular reasoning . samuraiknitter <MASK> it is noteworthy that , given that queen elizabeth wanted to express solidarity with canada , she did not choose to wear the maple leaf brooch she typically opts for on occasions associated with canada , so her choice of a different brooch must have had added significance . <PARA> however , no <MASK> suggests queen elizabeth was attempting to make any <MASK> relating to canada in the first place . once other ( arguably far more plausible ) explanations for her choice are advanced — such as the brooch ’ s sapphires matching the blue of her dress , for example — it cannot be accepted as a given that her choice of the jubilee brooch had anything to do with canada . <PARA> therefore , there is no reason to think that the choice of an unprecedented canada - related brooch , in particular , has any further symbolic significance , and the “ snowflake ” theory falls down as no more than wild speculation based on very shaky logical premises . <PARA> this is the case even if one accepts that queen elizabeth is familiar with the connotations of the term “ snowflake ” and that any expression of solidarity with canada must necessarily be an oblique attack upon president trump — two more assumptions that stretch credulity . <PARA> queen elizabeth ’ s brooch choices over the three days of president trump ’ s visit can easily , and much more plausibly , be explained by other factors , and accepting or speculating that she was engaging in a weekend - long rebuke to the u . s . president requires the acceptance of assumptions that are simply not supported by concrete <MASK> .",2018-07-19T18:34:55+00:00,train_6086,train,misinfo

1,"one of the major issues confronting modern librarians , archivists , and other preservers of information is how best to preserve that information . <PARA> the advent of digital media and formats such as hard drives , cds , dvds , and mp3s allows for much more efficient storage and retrieval of information , and in forms that are generally much less susceptible to damage from environmental factors ( e . g ., moisture , smoke , heat ). but those new media present some vexing issues of their own , chiefly the requirement of anticipating which of them will still be comfortably usable years from now . using cds to store files encoded in flac format may be a good choice for archiving a music collection today , but how easy will it be to find and use a device that can both read cds and run the software to decode and play flac - encoded music files ten , twenty , or a hundred years from now ? by comparison , a plain old book might be a comparatively inefficient and fragile means of storing written information , but even books printed hundreds of years ago are still readily usable by anyone who can read . <PARA> that issue is the conceit represented in the example <MASK> above , which maintains that the library of congress resolved the thorny issue of which medium to use for long - term storage of its extensive audio collection by opting for 78 rpm platters — because , as noted , although that format may have become outmoded over fifty years ago , it ’ s nonetheless durable and stores information in a form that “ can be reproduced with a very simple mechanical device and no electricity .” <PARA> however , no matter how logically this putative library of congress storage plan might be presented , it still raises some red flags : <PARA> for starters , 78 rpm platters are a terribly inefficient storage medium : they ’ re big ( 10 inches in diameter ), they ’ re thick , and they only hold a few minutes ’ worth of audio , so archiving an extensive collection of sound recordings to 78s would require an enormous amount of warehouse space . as well , such a scheme would present some difficult aesthetic issues , chiefly that any piece of music or other type of recorded material longer in duration than a few minutes would have to be split across multiple discs ( and sides of discs ). moreover , unlike digital storage media , analog media such as 78 rpm shellac disks significantly degrade with each use . <PARA> such skepticism would be well placed , as this item <MASK> as an april fool ’ s day treat perpetrated in an all things considered segment (“ shellac , the sound of the future ”) aired by national public radio ( npr ) on 1 april 2003 . for those who didn ’ t catch on to the gag earlier , the segment ’ s final line provided a practical coup de grâce : “ if funding levels can be maintained , experts estimate the archiving project can catch up with recordings made before 2003 by april 1 , 2089 .” <PARA> that npr ’ s 2003 april fool ’ s prank is still generating “ is this <MASK> ?” queries to us several years later is a testament to its creator ’ s ability to tread a fine line between absurdity and believability .",2009-05-03T10:03:04+00:00,train_6730,train,misinfo

i can ’ t really see how a toddler could do this on the same level ... however , i would not put it out of the question .” <PARA> while we did find some references to “ boys ” playing the role of “ african dodger ,” hughes pointed out that “ in jim crow times , many black men were called ‘ boys ,’ so it would be hard to determine the age of most of the ‘ dodgers .'” <PARA> similarly , not every game billed as such involved real human beings . at times , wooden “ heads ” or effigies stood in for real african - americans . it ’ s unclear whether the camp minikani version of the game shown in the viral facebook post above used inanimate objects or people as targets . <PARA> hughes told us that choosing an artificial target over a human one was not necessarily a sign that a particular carnival operator was especially progressive - minded . “ sometimes it was easier just to have a wooden target ,” he said . <PARA> and as hughes documented in his 2012 <MASK> , some carnival owners came up with a less physically dangerous ( but no less racist and demeaning ) alternative to the african dodger : the “ african dip ,” which appears to have made its debut during the summer of 1910 and involved black men being dunked in water every time a target was hit . <PARA> the new jersey paper trenton <MASK> american described this form of carnival attraction in 1911 as follows : <PARA> the popularity of the game meant that it had significant cultural impact , appearing in movies , newspaper “ funny pages ,” and in cartoons , including popeye . at times in the early 20th century , the idiom “ playing african dodger ” was used as shorthand for “ avoiding uncomfortable questions ,” especially in the context of political debate and journalism . <PARA> this video collage , produced by hughes for the jim crow museum , provides good insight into the disturbing popularity and prevalence of this terrible tradition :",2018-02-27T00:36:00+00:00,train_6344,train,info

charlottesville . <PARA> the facts about ross , the historical person , differ greatly from the myth . although she was born into a quaker family and the quakers were opposed to slavery , her personal views on the subject are unknown because no historical documentation from her point of view ( letters , journals , or other records ) is known to survive . that ’ s largely because ross was not famous until well after her death , according marla r . miller , professor of <MASK> at the university of massachusetts at amherst and author of the book “ betsy ross and the making of america .” <PARA> “ there is no document that answers the specific question ” about her views on slavery , miller told us by phone . “ we do know that she was a member of the quaker community , raised in the quaker tradition , and that in these decades , the quaker community increasingly rejected slavery .” <PARA> only slight <MASK> exists that documents ross ’ work making flags during the war of independence . she was a craftswoman in the upholstery trades . she did make numerous flags for the federal government alongside her daughter , clarissa wilson , particularly in the years before the war of 1812 . the design of the american flag evolved over the course of the revolutionary era , and no <MORE> first american flag . <PARA> ross was indeed raised in the quaker tradition , although she was forced out of the faith when she married john ross , an anglican . she was widowed and remarried twice , returning to the quaker tradition later in life with the formation of the free quakers after the revolutionary war . <PARA> there ’ s a reason for that lack of historical clarity around the <MASK> of the flag , said marc leepson , historian and author of the book “ flag : an american biography .” during ross ’ lifetime , flags weren ’ t endowed with the type of sanctity characteristic of current norms — so the making of flags wasn ’ t considered noteworthy . <PARA> furthermore , an official flag design didn ’ t exist until president william howard taft signed an order designating one in 1912 . popular images depicting washington crossing the delaware with the betsy ross flag , for instance , are apocryphal . the oldest physical flag with that configuration of stars found to date was made in the early 1800s . <PARA> “ we don ’ t know who made the first american flag ,” leepson told us . “ it wouldn ’ t have been newsworthy that someone made the first flag , because people didn ’ t feel even remotely the same way about it like they do now .” <PARA> adulation of the flag , in the way that it is done now , started in the north at the commencement of the american civil war , leepson said . after the war , it spread nationwide . the symbol of a nation united after a bloody civil war was part of the flag ’ s newfound importance , leepson noted . <PARA> miller theorizes that the <MASK> of ross and the first american flag took off because the time period her descendants were going public with it coincided with the women ’ s suffrage movement . it solved a cultural problem by giving a woman an important place in the revolutionary war while doing something domestic and non -

yes . but if nitrosamines even in small quantities were dangerous , then one would also have to avoid , according to a 1990 review , “ bacon , ham , frankfurters , sausage , cured meat products , poultry , fish , and fish products , cheese , beer , malt , grain , margarine , edible vegetable oils , water , air , and soil .” <PARA> finally , the howstuffworks post discussed two sulphate compounds : <PARA> both sls and sles can , like any detergent compound that removes oil from your skin , cause irritation . the <MASK> that sls interacts with estrogen in humans is not found in any of the 3 , 155 scientific <MASK> listed on the pubchem website for the chemical , nor in any of the 306 <MASK> in the national institute of health ’ s curated list of research related to sls ’ s adverse effects . <PARA> the argument regarding dioxane is similar to the nitrosamine argument above , as the compound can introduced as an impurity during synthesis of the above sulfate compounds . its presence in many cosmetics , as well as its carcinogenicity , are not in question . however , at concentrations found even in the most egregiously contaminated shaving creams ( further diluted by other slime ingredients ), it would not pose a credible health risk . <PARA> while we cannot rank the specific personal circumstances described in the “ this talk ain ’ t cheap ” post , we can say that <MASK> of other more terrifying slime - related health concerns are not rooted in reality , so long as one is not actively eating the final product or breathing copious amounts of dry borax during its production .",2017-03-21T04:35:21+00:00,train_6829,train,misinfo

1,"french designer louis vuitton ( 1821 - 1892 ), whose initials are enshrined in the name of the multi - billion - dollar fashion conglomerate lvmh , began his career as an apprentice malletier ( trunk maker ) in paris in the 1830s . <PARA> over time , he parlayed his artisanship into a successful business catering to upper - class parisians , opening his first independent shop in 1854 . by the time of his death in 1892 , the louis vuitton brand was synonymous with luxury , a reputation built upon by his son and subsequent generations of the vuitton family . <PARA> according to an assortment of memes making the social media rounds since early 2019 , that brand was tainted by its alleged participation an 19th - and early 20th - century phenomenon known as “ human zoos .” these were zoo - like exhibitions of so - called “ primitive ” peoples displayed in world ’ s fairs and traveling shows in europe and the united <MASK> during the era of global colonialism . though they were more often known at the time by the quasi - scientific name “ ethnological exhibitions ,” these displays came to be seen as emblematic of the racism and inhumanity underlying the colonialist mindset . <PARA> the memes allege that louis vuitton “ sponsored ” such exhibitions in major cities throughout the world : <PARA> the posts failed to make clear whether the allegation is meant to apply to louis vuitton , the man , or louis vuitton , the company , or both . they also failed to provide any real evidentiary support for the allegation . <PARA> some of the posts , such as the facebook message above ( since deleted ), included a link to the blog “ brand memory ,” which contains an <MASK> mentioning that louis vuitton showcased products at several world ’ s fairs and at the 1931 paris colonial exposition , at which , the <MASK> says , “ human zoos ” were exhibited . <PARA> but the <MASK> doesn ’ t <MASK> that the company ( louis vuitton was long deceased by 1931 ) actually played any part in such zoos . the mentions appear in these paragraphs describing a 2010 carnavalet museum retrospective on the evolution of the vuitton style ( emphasis added ): <PARA> though the sentence above is poorly translated and vague , it ’ s clear enough that the clause referring to “ human zoos ” applies to the 1931 colonial exposition as a whole , not the louis vuitton pavilion , which existed but had no evident connection to displays of live human beings . according to a museum press release , in keeping with the colonial theme , the vuitton pavilion showcased africa - themed products ( mainly trunks ) and artifacts such as masks and totems . ( the photograph that appears in the social media posts shows that pavilion . it was not , contrary to what the facebook meme <MASK> , a “ louis vuitton store exhibition ” in st . louis .) <PARA> in point of fact , according to historical accounts , the only display in the colonial exposition of 1931 rightly described as a “ human zoo ” ( namely , a group of indigenous new caledonians — “ kanaks ” — sensationally billed as “ polygamous savages and cannibals ”) was relegated to an offsite location miles away from the main exposition grounds . people ( mainly artisans ) from other indigenous groups intermingled with visitors and represented their cultures in the exposition proper ( in the bois de vincennes ), but the kanaks found themselves confined to the jardin d ’ acclimatation ( in the bois de boulogne ), which at that time also housed an actual zoo with crocodiles and other exotic animals . <PARA> infamously , the jardin d ’ acclimatation had housed a succession of mocked - up “ native villages ” since 1877 , populated at various times by colonized indigenous peoples . the kanak exhibition would be the last of its kind there before the venue was turned into an amusement park . in what some might perceive as an ironic development , the headquarters of the fondation louis vuitton , a non - profit entity founded by lvmh to promote international arts and culture , was erected in 2014 in close proximity to where those “ human zoo ” exhibitions of previous centuries once stood . <PARA> but we found nothing in any of the historical sources we examined to connect louis vuitton to any such displays — not at the 1931 paris colonial exposition , not at world ’ s fairs where the company was known to have displayed its wares , and not in traveling shows in the united <MASK> or other parts of the world . while it could be argued that the company engaged in cultural appropriation over the course of its long <MASK> , and perhaps even profited from the trappings of colonialism , the charge that louis vuitton sponsored or facilitated “ human zoos ” stands unproven . <PARA> we reached out to the louis vuitton company and the fondation louis vuitton for comment on this subject , but did not receive replies .",2019-03-15T21:43:07+00:00,train_2883,train,misinfo

protection program from which he emerged in august 2019 to perpetrate a mass shooting . <PARA> according to proponents of the “ 2014 death ” theory , three similarities connect the connor betts who died in connecticut in 2014 and the one dayton police named as the suspected gunman in a mass shooting during the early hours of aug . 4 , 2019 , and whom police fatally shot at that time : <PARA> these similarities , the theory goes , can only be explained or can best be explained by an elaborate plot of some kind , whether it involved a faked death in 2014 , the suspected dayton shooter assuming an existing identity , or some other conspiracy . <PARA> the obituary cited by those promoting the conspiracy theory marked the tragic death of connor d . betts , a young man from suffield , connecticut who had just turned 22 when he was killed in an accident while working for a local construction company on feb . 19 , 2014 . <PARA> however , the man named by dayton police as the suspect in the august 2019 mass shooting was connor stephen betts — a different person with a different middle name . connor s . betts , the suspected shooter , was listed on electoral rolls as having a birth year of 1994 ( which comports with dayton police ’ s confirmation that his age was 24 ), and was registered to vote in greene county , ohio , and took part in elections there since 2012 — that is , both before and after the death of connor d . betts in connecticut in 2014 . <PARA> connor d . betts and connor s . betts did each have a sister named megan , however they are also two separate individuals . according to dayton police , megan betts was 22 years old when she was shot to death during the aug . 4 massacre of which her brother is suspected . on the greene county , ohio , voter rolls , she was listed as having been born in 1997 and residing at the same address as connor s . betts , her brother and the dayton shooting suspect . her full name was listed as megan kathleen betts . <MORE> betts ’ sister is highly likely to be megan b . betts , and that she was highly likely to have been born in 1986 , not 1997 . each megan betts is or was a completely different person , separated by more than a decade in age , and bearing little or no physical resemblance to one another . <PARA> the third plank of the conspiracy theories was the <MASK> that connor d . betts and connor s . betts had the same physical appearance , meaning they must have been the same person . setting aside the fact that connor d . betts did in fact die in 2014 , and any <MASK> to the contrary were liable to be deeply hurtful to his loved ones , the two men did not look the same . <PARA> at first glance , some photographs showed a certain passing resemblance between them , but a closer examination revealed that any similarities were no more than superficial . a photographic tribute to connor d . betts , posted shortly after his death in 2014 , contained dozens of photographs of him . the full scope of those photographs demonstrates clearly that he and connor s . betts were completely different individuals . <PARA> at first glance , the coincidences involved in this conspiracy theory might appear impossibly unlikely to some observers , giving rise to the conclusion that “ something else ” must surely be afoot . in reality , they are not so unlikely at all . <PARA> according to social security administration ( ssa ) data , “ connor ” was the 48th most popular boy ’ s name in connecticut in 1992 ( the year in which connor d . betts was born ). in 1986 , the year in which megan b . betts was born , “ megan ” was the 22nd most popular girl ’ s name in the <MASK> . there are therefore lots of connors and lots of megans in the <MASK> of connecticut , and the possibility of finding two siblings with those names and respective ages , is much greater than it otherwise would be , due to the popularity of those first names . <PARA> it is also not that unlikely to find the same brother - sister name pairing replicated in another <MASK> , in this case ohio . the same ssa data shows that “ connor ” was the 63rd most popular boy ’ s name in ohio in 1994 , the year of connor stephen betts ’ birth , and “ megan ” was the ninth most popular girl ’ s name in the <MASK> in 1997 , the year in which megan kathleen betts was born . plenty of connors , even more megans , live in that <MASK> , so a reasonable possibility exists of finding a brother and sister with those names and a two or three - year age gap between them .",2019-08-05 22:47:02+00:00,test_295,test,misinfo

1,"glurge : account of a denver physician who helped a woman in distress . <PARA> i just had one of the most amazing experiences of my life , and wanted to share it with my family and dearest friends : <PARA> i was driving home from a meeting this evening about 5 , stuck in traffic on colorado blvd ., and the car started to choke and splutter and die – i barely managed to coast , cursing , into a gas <MASK> , glad only that i would not be blocking traffic and would have a somewhat warm spot to wait for the tow truck . it wouldn ’ t even turn over . <PARA> before i could make the call , i saw a woman walking out of the “ quickie mart ” building , and it looked like she slipped on some ice and fell into a gas pump , so i got out to see if she was okay . <PARA> when i got there , it looked more like she had been overcome by sobs than that she had fallen ; she was a young woman who looked really haggard with dark circles under her eyes . she dropped something as i helped her up , and i picked it up to give it to her . it was a nickel . <PARA> at that moment , everything came into focus for me : the crying woman , the ancient suburban crammed full of stuff with 3 kids in the back ( 1 in a car seat ), and the gas pump reading $ 4 . 95 . i asked her if she was okay and if she needed help , and she just kept saying “ i don ’ t want my kids to see me crying ,” so we stood on the other side of the pump from her car . she said she was driving to california and that things were very hard for her right now . <PARA> so i asked , “ and you were praying ?” that made her back away from me a little but i assured her i was not a crazy person and said , “ he heard you , and he sent me .” <PARA> i took out my card and swiped it through the card reader on the pump so she could fill up her car completely , and while it was fueling walked to the next door mcdonald ’ s and bought 2 big bags of food , some gift certificates for more , and a big cup of coffee . she gave the food to the kids in the car who attacked it like wolves , and we stood by the pump eating fries and talking a little . she told me her name , and that she lived in kansas city . her boyfriend left 2 months ago and she had not been able to make ends meet . she knew <MORE> , “ sorry , but we simply can ’ t give cash . we ’ ll do anything else we can , but we won ’ t give you cash .” <PARA> my rule became to never give cash , but to do everything in my power to provide whatever other kind of material assistance was requested , and i shared this policy with my parishioners and other pastors . by following this policy , we were able to help many times when people actually did need to have prescriptions purchased , food , gas , rent or utilities paid , etc . we would go to the drugstore with them to purchase the prescription , go to the gas <MASK> and pump the gas for them , serve a meal , go to the utility <PARA> company or landlord and pay bills – but never , ever give anyone a single dime in cash . naturally , when such an offer of direct aid is made , a number of the people i encountered who <MASK> they needed help found some reason why it wouldn ’ t work : they were in too much of a hurry , the office / store / pharmacy was closed , etc . in those cases the response was always , “ sorry , but we simply can ’ t give cash . we ’ ll do anything else we can , but we won ’ t give you cash .” <PARA> our desire to believe what we ’ ve been told coupled with our urge to perform occasional good deeds leaves us vulnerable to the ‘ distressed stranger ’ con . we take folks at face value , which sets us up as pigeons to be taken advantage <PARA> when presented with tales of woe and asked for relatively small sums that will help set things to rights , only the very rarest among us will as a matter of course turn down direct appeals for help . the vast majority will hear the unfortunates out , then make their decision to help or not based on the believability of the stories . <PARA> given that the con artists working “ stranger in distress ” cons are making their livings at churning out one touching tale after another , their come - ons are often quite believable . our ability to filter often proves no protection . <PARA> the underlying message of the physician ’ s account of her experience at a gas <MASK> in denver is the good of heart should look for opportunities to help their fellow man and when they see them , act upon them . while that is a praiseworthy endeavor to undertake , those so motivated need also consider that the not - so - good of heart are simultaneously out there looking for them . <PARA> barbara “ help wanted ” mikkelson <PARA> how to avoid falling victim to ‘ distressed stranger ’ scams :",2012-02-28T09:50:24+00:00,test_76,test,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : the crew of alaska airlines flight 261 wrestled with a jammed stabilizer for 11 or 12 minutes , trying to maintain altitude and guide their plane to an emergency landing , before the airliner finally plunged into the pacific ocean near port hueneme on 31 january 2000 . during that period , the flight attendants would have ensured that every passenger was in his seat with his belt fastened , prepared for an emergency landing . it didn ’ t take long before the tale of on - board pastors offering a final prayer over the plane ’ s intercom system during those final minutes began to circulate on the internet . this literal truthfulness of this is not supported by any known <MASK> , <PARA> however . <PARA> according to the national transportation safety board , all that can be heard on the cockpit voice recorder tape is the pilots discussing stabilizer problems with air traffic control and alaska air maintenance personnel , a loud noise around the time the plane lost stabilizer control ( and the voice of a flight attendant notifying the crew of the sound ), and a second loud bang a minute before the plane plunged into the ocean . no passenger - led prayer appears on the tape . <PARA> as well , the <MASK> “ there is no good explanation for how the plane was able to stay in the air for those final 9 minutes ” is just silly . the pilots regained control of the plane after it suddenly dropped 23 , 700 feet in ninety seconds and were still attempting to troubleshoot the problem when the plane dropped into the ocean about 12 minutes later . the cause of that final plunge was failure of the stabilizer jackscrew threads caused by inadequate lubrication and maintenance / inspection , according to the ntsb ‘ s report on the crash , thus rather than there being “ no good explanation ” for how the plane was able to stay up until then ; a more accurate <MASK> would be to say that “ there is no good explanation why the plane suddenly dived into the sea 9 minutes later .” in fact , as late as four minutes before the fatal dive , the pilots were requesting clearance to make an emergency landing at los angeles international airport . <PARA> this tale appears to be based on a distortion ( deliberate or otherwise ) of something said by jeff knight of monroe , washington , whose parents , joe and linda knight , were co - pastors of the rock church and were aboard flight 261 when it crashed . a few months after the tragedy , jeff told an associated press reporter that his mother would have been “ standing in the aisle of the struggling jet , preaching and helping frightened people find god ,” while his father would have “ been writing a note ” to his two children ( jeff and 16 - year - old sister jenny ) and his daughter - in - law ( jeff ’ s wife ). “ that ’ s the way they were ,” he said . “ i know them so well . a lot of people met jesus that day through my mom .” maybe that ’ s what jeff would like to believe his parents did , but his conviction is purely one of faith . <PARA> if a private company tried to turn the flight 261 disaster into a commercial for their product , an outraged public would probably hound them out of business . why should we be any less offended when someone fabricates the details of a tragedy in order to turn it into a commercial for jesus ?",2009-02-12T13:39:26+00:00,test_229,test,misinfo

down between trump and msnbc interviewer chris matthews , clips ( and transcripts ) of which circulated online prior to the segment ’ s initial broadcast : <PARA> trump averred in the interview that “ there has to be some form of punishment for the woman ” ( who obtains an abortion if such a procedure were not legal ): <PARA> absent from the available portions of the then - unaired segment was some of the context of the conversation between matthews and trump that led up to the latter ’ s controversial <MASK> . most transcripts or clips commenced with matthews asking whether “ the woman ” should be “ punished for having an abortion ,” suggesting that the interchange didn ’ t start there and some previous discussion had been elided . moreover , from what little was known of the segment at the time , it appeared that matthews ( not trump ) was the first to introduce the concept of “ punishment ” in reference to abortion . trump visibly struggled to navigate two related but different concepts : the current legality of abortion in america , and a hypothetical future in which abortion was illegal and subject to ( criminal ) penalties . <PARA> rival campaigns quickly weighed in on the controversy . democrats hillary clinton and bernie sanders condemned the remarks , and a campaign staffer for republican ted cruz characterized trump ’ s remarks as ignorant from the perspective of the anti - abortion movement : <PARA> a prominent anti - abortion group commented on the issue and denied that legal sanctions for women were a goal of the movement ( though opponents have historically <MASK> otherwise ): <PARA> trump issued a contradictory <MASK> on 30 march 2016 asserting that he was “ pro - life with exceptions ” and holding that if abortion were banned , “ the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible , not the woman ”: <PARA> in the cacophonous brouhaha , we were unable to locate a transcript or video segment that included of the exchange leading up to matthews ’ question . presumably , the question of breaking hypothetical anti - abortion laws didn ’ t arise abruptly , and a prior exchange included the context necessary to properly parse trump ’ s answers . it wasn ’ t even clear if the aired footage would include the discussion leading up to the exchange in question . nbc trump correspondent katy tur published several clarifying tweets about the controversy underscoring the context of the remarks and adding that the position reluctantly espoused by trump was one from which anti - abortion operatives typically distanced themselves : <PARA> the debate between matthews and trump over the legal <MASK> of abortion was not novel . abortion rights advocates frequently approach the subject from that hypothetical viewpoint and have embraced the question as a rhetorical tool in abortion debate : <PARA> tur ’ s series of tweets included one that placed the comment in the context of ongoing abortion debate , while trump ’ s inability to answer the question succinctly was interpreted by anti - abortion groups and individuals as an indication he might be unfamiliar with the anti - abortion movement ’ s details : <PARA> in fairness to trump , the question was very difficult to answer given its largely rhetorical nature ( especially given that it has no “ right ” answer , and any answer would inevitably disappoint a large segment of the audience ). <PARA> donald trump responded to a question by saying there should be “ some form of punishment for the woman ” who obtained an abortion if the procedure were illegal , but that answer appeared to be one made in the context of a hypothetical discussion about bans on abortion that do not currently exist . trump did not <MASK> that women should be subject to punishment for having abortions under the law as it stands , nor did he voice a forceful opinion without extensive wheedling from matthews . <PARA> the scenario in which trump ’ s remarks occurred is often presented with the <MASK> intent of prompting abortion opponents to consider the full extent of their position rather than to elicit an honest answer . trump didn ’ t appear to have any position on hypothetical consequences for abortions were they outlawed before the question was asked , and he made several attempts to dodge the thread of the discussion ( but was pressed for an answer by matthews ). since the clip began circulating , the trump campaign had made multiple attempts to clarify his position on abortion , and we were unable to locate any prior <MASK> from trump proactively suggesting that women who had abortions should be punished .",2016-03-30T22:25:05+00:00,train_2996,train,misinfo

1,"i would like to bring to your attention a terrible incident which happened to me on friday 2nd february 2007 at approximately 18 . 05 . i had left work ( 8 king street , manchester ) and i proceeded up king st . there were plenty of people around finishing work for the weekend and about half way up king street ( outside the white company ) a woman had come out of the walk through from st ann ’ s square and said to me she was having a terrible day as she had just found her husband in bed with another woman . i thought it was strange that she would tell a complete stranger this information so i carried on walking . she then stopped me and asked for 32 pence to catch the bus home . <PARA> i was immediately suspicious of the situation as i would imagine a bus to anywhere would be more than 32 pence and she wasn ’ t the stereotypical person that normally asks you for change for the bus . she was clean , well dressed and well spoken . she also had a handbag . feeling uncomfortable with the situation i agreed to give her some change , just so i could get away as promptly as possible . i gave her what change i had which was approximately 80 pence . she then said she was grateful and she ’ d send me £ 20 back . i thought she was going to ask for my address ( which i wouldn ’ t have given ) but she didn ’ t . she said thank you and squeezed my arm as a token of appreciation . as she walked away she dropped some of the money & didn ’ t retrieve it which certainly aroused suspicions ; if she didn ’ t need the money why did she stop me ? <PARA> i proceeded up king st towards cross street but realised something was wrong . my left hand side had gone completely numb and my arm went into a spasm . i knew she had done something to me when she touched my arm . <PARA> i needed to tell someone quickly what had happened as i assumed in a few seconds i would be unconscious and what i assume would be her accomplice would be waiting for me to be completely helpless and do the unthinkable to me . i managed to get my phone out of pocket and just pressed last number re - dial . <PARA> at the same time i stopped a lady and realised i sounded stupid at what i was saying but she could also hear me on the phone so she realised i was genuine . i started to lose the power of speech . she stayed with me and we got to bootle street police <MASK> . <PARA> my arm was hurting but whatever i was injected with <MORE> injected with , and although i still await the results of blood tests they are only checking for diseases i may have been given . the police are confident it will be caught on cctv and i await father information in that regard . <PARA> the reason for sending this e - mail is to please ask you to warn everyone you know , not just women but men too and ask them to tell girlfriends , wives , sisters & mothers . the message needs to get through to be extra vigilant . <PARA> i was one of the lucky ones ( blood results pending ) and if i can make people aware of these people then i ’ d like to think it can make a difference . <PARA> <MASK> : every now and then , one of the lurid “ this could happen to you !” warnings circulated in e - mail turns out to have something to it . this is one that might , although at this point we ’ re keeping an open <PARA> mind . <PARA> according to the bbc , an unnamed 32 - year - old female victim was attacked in the manner described in the e - mail reproduced above around 6 p . m . on 2 february 2007 in manchester , england . after being stopped in the street and accosted for funds by a woman not known to her , she gave some of her pocket change to the stranger , whereupon her assailant grabbed her arm and scratched it with an unknown implement . the victim immediately felt unwell and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment , but was later discharged . <PARA> this is a curious tale ; despite the bbc <MASK> about the incident , we ’ re not sure the attack happened . the bbc piece was drawn from what the victim told police had happened to her , but independent confirmation of the <MASK> ’ s elements is lacking . there were no witnesses to the attack ( or least none are reported to have come forward ). no follow - up accounts have appeared in the news with information about the results of the blood tests . there have been no reports of similar assaults on others or of other curious encounters with anyone matching the description of the mysterious panhandler . <PARA> the dearth of reportage of additional assaults in manchester might be due to this occurrence ’ s having been an isolated incident , but lacking some element of independent confirmation , we ’ ll leave this one as “ undetermined ” for now . it is worth pointing out that similar attacks have been reported in other places at other times ( e . g ., a may 1999 assault in towson , maryland , by a panhandler wielding a syringe upon a woman at a gas <MASK> ). <PARA> barbara “ sticking point ” mikkelson",2011-07-26T21:59:38+00:00,train_2176,train,misinfo
1,"<MASK> : in 1992 , newlyweds john and kim puckett , both recent mba recipients , developed a vision for a gourmet coffee company while “ hoofing around alaska ’ s denali park .” pursuing that vision , they raised the capital to open the first caribou coffee shops in minneapolis , minnesota , in 1993 . ( if you ’ re wondering why anyone would challenge the now - giant starbucks in this line of business , note that at the start of 1992 the starbucks chain had a mere 116 outlets <PARA> nationwide .) <PARA> unfortunately , the new venture was plagued by problems nearly from the start , and by 1996 caribou board members were expressing concern about the company ’ s operating problems . in 1997 , jay willoughby , an operations expert from pepsico , was brought into the fold ; although the chain opened nearly 50 stores that year , its growth was halted at about 90 outlets in 1998 while the company sought to address its operating issues . in 1999 the pucketts were replaced by mcdonald ’ s veteran don dempsey as chairman and chief executive , but by the end of 2000 the company ran out of cash and could not raise any more operating capital from its investors ( who had already kicked in more than $ 40 million through several rounds of financing ). so , in december 2000 , caribou coffee company , inc . announced that it was selling a 70 % stake ( later to become an 87 . 8 %) to atlanta - based crescent capital , a deep - pockets investor backed by first islamic investment bank of bahrain for $ 80 million ; founders john and kim puckett left the board , but ceo don dempsey stayed on to run the company for the new owners . <PARA> should any of this be a cause of concern to coffee lovers , especially since caribou coffee is second only to seattle - based starbucks ( albeit a distant second , with a couple of hundred stores to starbucks ’ 4 , 700 ) as the usa ’ s largest chain of non - franchised specialty coffeehouses ? <PARA> the impression many people are taking from the message <MASK> above is : “ oh , no ; caribou is owned by islamic militants , the same people who are trying to kill us !” that isn ’ t what the message <MASK> , however . the protest was that the chairman of the first islamic investment bank ’ s supervisory board ( which advises first islamic on issues of islamic law regarding its investments ) was also on the supervisory board of the union for good , a coalition of charities ( such as the london - based interpal ) providing various means of relief to palestinians . the message notes that there is “ nothing wrong with a charity to help palestinians ” but <MORE> the effects of the sanction . <PARA> certainly the <MASK> that al - aqsa intifada “ is the latest of a long line of affliction faced by the people of palestine ,” that palestinians were “ massacred ” at deir yassin , and that palestine has been “ illegally occupied ” since 1948 would be hotly contested by many pro - israel groups , but it ’ s hardly surprising to find a pro - palestinian focus on the web site of a middle eastern - based palestinian relief organization . perhaps some of us believe that all charitable groups should be apolitical ( and those that aren ’ t should be avoided ), but the reality is that many charitable organizations are decidedly partisan . ( for the record , the union for good is not on the usa ’ s list of organizations that support terrorism .) <PARA> however , dr . al - qaradawi “ has certainly said he does not think acts of violence against israeli citizens is terrorism ,” and he is noted for his virulently anti - american stance and other viewpoints that many westerners find abhorrent : <PARA> an egyptian - born theologian , sheik yusuf abdullah al - qaradawi , with a <MASK> of anti - american militancy even longer than sheik fadlallah ’ s , expresses a similar view . from his base in the persian gulf <MASK> of qatar , the 75 - year - old sheik has issued islamic fatwas , or decrees , on issues like the need for muslims to boycott mcdonald ’ s restaurants , and on husbands ’ right to beat their wives as long as they do not draw blood . 1 <PARA> granted , dr . al - qaradawi ’ s views were made as a private citizen rather than as an office of caribou ( and we ’ ve discussed on other pages that what a corporate board member does as a private citizen and what he does in his official capacity as an officer of corporation are two very different things ), so the political stance of a first islamic investment bank advisory board member is not necessarily reflective of the bank ’ s corporate policies . but given the nature of the islamic shari ’ ah , issues of business , politics , and religion are inextricably intertwined , and dr . al - qaradawi did have a “ significant association ” with caribou ’ s banker , first islamic . 2 <PARA> in july 2002 , the first islamic investment bank announced that they had severed all ties with dr . al - qaradawi , so the issue is now moot . first islamic also hired washington , d . c ., law firm gibson , dunn & crutcher to review its charitable donations , and they have certified that no charitable contributions from caribou ’ s coffers go to groups banned under u . s . law .",2009-08-20T04:11:38+00:00,train_7410,train,misinfo

0,"after more than four decades of protective <MASK> , the federal government moved to officially delist gray wolf populations in the lower 48 u . s . <MASK> from the endangered species act ( esa ). the delisting was announced by u . s . secretary of the interior david bernhardt on oct . 29 , 2020 . <PARA> “ the service based its final determination solely on the best scientific and commercial data available , a thorough analysis of threats and how they have been alleviated and the ongoing commitment and proven track record of <MASK> and tribes to continue managing for healthy wolf populations once delisted ,” wrote the department of the interior in a news release . “ this analysis includes the latest information about the wolf ’ s current and historical distribution in the contiguous united <MASK> .” <PARA> the move transfers the power of management , responsibility , and protection to <MASK> and tribal wildlife management agencies in <MASK> with populations the u . s . fish and wildlife service ( fws ) consider recovered . fws will continue to monitor the species until 2025 to ensure its success . <PARA> esa is a conservation law in effect for more than four decades that has ensured the success of 99 % of all listed species , according to the natural resource defense council . gray wolves joined the list in 1974 after the canine was decimated by hunting and poaching in the early 1900s by people who targeted wolves largely because of their predation on hunted species like deer and elk , as well as concerns over livestock depredation . <PARA> in 2019 , the trump administration issued changes to regulations in how the esa was interpreted , allowing for a delisting determination based on a “ minimalist interpretation ” that some argued could set precedent for scaling back of other recovery efforts for species . in particular , these changes weakened protections for threatened species by removing blanket protections and allowed for economic analyses to be considered in delisting propositions . <PARA> the 2020 delisting applies to nearly all wolf populations in u . s . <MASK> and territories , with the exception of alaska and hawaii , but it ’ s not the first time that restrictions have been stripped for the species . fws delisted gray wolves in the northern rockies and great lakes in may 2009 , at which point <MASK> officials began the transition to assume management , but the change faced many legal challenges over the next decade . in its move to remove federal protections for gray wolves in 2020 , the trump administration said that its decision was based on the “ best scientific and commercial data available ” and was determined based on five factors , including threats to their habitat , disease or predation , the inadequacy of current regulatory mechanisms , and other factors that might impact their existence . <PARA> at the time of writing , it is estimated that there are 6 , 000 individual wolves in the lower 48 <MASK> , a number that exceeded combined recovery goals for the northern rocky mountains and western great lakes populations . <PARA> “ after more than 45 years as a listed species , the gray wolf has exceeded all conservation goals for recovery . today ’ s announcement simply reflects the determination that this species is neither a threatened nor endangered species based on the specific factors congress has laid out in the law ,” said bernhardt in a news release at the time . <PARA> after the rule was <MASK> published online on march 14 , 2019 , it received more than 107 , 000 public comments . proponents , many of whom were republican leaders from <MASK> with established gray wolf populations , said that the delisting was an “ endangered species act success <MASK> ” and marked an opportunity for <MASK> leaders to implement their own measures unique to their area , removing “ federal red tape and abusive litigation ” to allow ranchers and livestock managers an opportunity to protect their herds from growing threats of gray wolves . <PARA> opponents included conservation groups like the defenders of wildlife , the center for biological diversity , the humane society veterinary medical association , 100 scientists , and more than 200 businesses who argued that it was too soon to determine whether the species had recovered and that the populations are not stable enough to be managed by <MASK> and local governments , particularly as the large predators do stay within <MASK> boundaries . <PARA> a study published in the october 2020 issue of bioscience , a journal published by the american institute of biological science , rebutted the government ’ s decision and proposed framework , citing gaps in conservation coverage between <MASK> and increasing threats from climate change and other factors altering ecosystems . in particular , the researchers note that conservation measures need to coordinate two specific elements of the esa , both distinct populations and their return to traditional ranges . <PARA> the final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the federal register on nov . 3 , 2020 , and will go into effect on jan .

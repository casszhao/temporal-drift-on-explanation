        "text": "apparently it works fine , for it disappears after each wash . the main issue i have with this product is that it comes in powder form , making it a little on the inconvenient side to dispense properly . since our dishwasher does not have any compartment for powder form , and i believe most of the newer ones do not , you are required to pour it at the bottom of the dishwasher and let the machine handle the rest . besides the gel packs we currently use and the liquid finish to aid in the drying process this product could be construed as overkill , but we really enjoy to see the end results delivering a consistent extra clean , extra dry , spot free wash . for the reason alone that it came in powder form ( i had assumed from the picture that it would be liquid and that it could go on the liquid dispenser ) i rated it a little lower . i have not experienced left overs of the powder , as some reviewers claimed . in that case , of course , this product would be almost useless . so far it has worked in that it disappears completely from the bottom where it is placed . i tried it once by putting a flat glass cup plate at the bottom and filling it up . it also disappeared leaving only a very small residue of water on the plate . i found it inconvenient so i started using directly as instructed . dishes and glasses have been thoroughly cleaned , but like i mentioned i use the gel pack and the liquid finish rinse in addition , so in the end i got an above performance when i used the qqq products . does it clean less without this one product ? maybe so , but i was getting a very nice clean before adding the finish power up booster agent , qqq ounce , so i can not say for how much the cleaning has improved . would i buy this same product again ? probably not , knowing that there are so many other products of equal performance that do not require that method of usage . they recommend to qqq tbs but i probably use a little more , for it is hard to be precise whey you are just pouring . once again very thankful to amazon , a class act from way back , for allowing me to try this product , and i rate this product qqq , mostly for the inconvenient way in which it has to be used",

( < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"/kirkland - signature - qqq - pounds / dp / qqq / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = qqq signature walnuts , qqq pounds</a>&nbsp;are excellent ) . you can add bananas , berries , brown sugar , honey , maple syrup or any other sweetener . you can also make granola bars or oatmeal cookies with oatmeal , of course . note : the pictured canister is not included . this is simply a very large bulk box of oatmeal . inside are two plain qqq lb plastic bags . i recommend saving your empty canisters to put the oats in , for daily use . the rest , you can put back in the box and store until you need to refill the canister . this will make it easier to handle the oats , versus a big clumsy bag .",

        "text": "i enjoy both cheddar cheese and i like the well known sour cream and onion flavor , so i that it would be a wise decision to try these chips that combine those two flavors . i can honestly tell you i was not disappointed ! the flavor is a little hard to describe but as you would imagine , you get a nice cheesy overtone with the distinctive flavor of sour cream near the end . they are quite addictive and not as salty as one would imagine . they are fairly thin and crispy so i would not recommend these for any kind of thick dip because they will break apart . they are perfectly fine by themselves anyway and do n't require any kind of topping at all since they already come coated with that unique flavoring . being that these are so light , you can hardly stop from eating them and they will go quickly in a house of hungry people ( this size bag would probably last my family anywhere from a week to two weeks or even as little as a day depending on our self - control ) . this would be a great idea for parties , especially if it was paired with another type of chip that could be used for dipping . this flavor would also be great for parties because it appeals to almost all people ( with taste buds ) . the common misconception is that these chip bags are all air , but that could not be further from the truth . while these bags do contain nitrogen to preserve the chips , they contain the same amount of chips as every other variety . i do find , however , that about qqq to qqq percent of the chips on the bottom get crushed , but this might not happen to everyone , and in reality , this phenomenon is quite normal . with a price so low and the convenience of buying these online , it is hard to pass up such a deal ! i highly recommend this product to everyone !",

( the reason i mention storage is because it 's not good to have pancake mix sitting around in an improperly sealed box or bag for long periods of time . i 've had enough bad experiences with mold to feel moved enough to share this here because this is the \" family size \" package that might end up sitting in your cabinet for a few months at least . i 've heard horror stories of people getting sick from mold toxin because just enough moisture slowly built up and mold grew , and it was n't easily noticeable , probably in part because of the consistency of the powdery medium not being a solid surface like you might notice mold on cheese for example . knowing what i know about mold , it 's probably not all that common , but if the box or bag sits around long enough in a moist climate without being completely sealed it might just be enough to allow slow growth of just the wrong kind of mold . what makes the nasty mold dangerous is the toxins it releases over time . so just do yourself a favor and invest in a storage container ( or use a big folger 's plastic \" can \" with a storage bag , like i did ) and keep your floury substances away from moisture and storage in a well - sealed container . ) on a happy note , forget doing these pancakes injustice with fake \" maple \" syrup . if you are willing to spend more than a dollar on a cup of coffee , why put junk on your pancakes ? go the extra mile with this vermont gold&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"/hidden - springs - natural - vermont - maple - syrup - amber - qqq - ounce / dp / qqq / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = qqq springs natural vermont maple syrup , amber rich , qqq ounce</a > . a little goes a long way . right now qqq oz is about $ qqq if you do subscribe and save .",

( note : comparison to brown sugar : i detected a hint of sweetness , but saw qqq point spike in my blood sugar at qqq - minutes ) . in beverages : the test : again to test this , i used qqq qqq oz glass of ice tea with no additional ingredients ( just loose leaf black tea i brew ) the product : i added qqq tsp of the coconut sugar ( qqq the suggested serving amount ) to my ice tea results : much the same as above . i found a slight color shift to brown , and no appreciable sweetening effect of the tea ( it tasted no sweeter than just plain ice tea , minus the flavor profile shift of the coconut sugar ) . comparison : my comparison was ( same as above ) to check my blood sugar immediately prior to consuming and then qqq minutes after consuming and again qqq hour after consuming . i found my blood sugar spiked slightly ( qqq points ) with the coconut sugar as opposed to plain ice tea or ice tea ( sweetened with qqq packet of equal ( qqq g of weight ) . i did not test with sugar at this time , as i felt my results between the oatmeal test and ice tea test already indicated a sufficient trend . c. nutritional value - the claim is the low glycemic and minerals and nutrients . according to the package 's nutritional information panel , the highest mineral concentration is potassium ( qqq mg ) followed by sodium ( qqq mg ) and rounding off the bottom : total carbohydrate ( qqq g ) and sugars ( qqq g ) . ( note : to compare , qqq average sized banana contains approximately qqq mg of potassium ( qqq % of the dra for an adult ) . conclusion : for me , i find no significant value in using this product in neither management of glycemic tolerance nor sweetening of food and beverage . while an argument can be made for nutritional benefit , this benefit , in my opinion , is negligible . basically , i find this product to be a non - functional \" sweetener \" with an unappetizing food colorization and slight flavor profile shift that provided no discernible sweetness . as to nutritional value , i find this product worst of all ) near - negligible nutritional value . i do n't find it a better option than just a balanced , nutritious diet . i do n't find it has significant benefit to diabetes management , and i strongly urge any diabetic to discuss the concerns of relying on this product to aid in diabetes care management with a licensed professional nutritionist / endocrinologist . the only benefit i did find , is it was less taxing on my insulin / blood sugar levels than equal amounts of refined sugar . in closing , these results are only self - observed . however , the results did show me that , for me anyway , the keys to proper weight control / diabetes management is sensibility and moderation .",

( i also often use all purpose flour with a little added vital wheat gluten instead of bread flour with great results . ) the red star yeast works wonderfully provided it 's active , fresh , and is used in the correct environment . if you are a beginning baker using yeast and you have been purchasing the small packets at the grocery store , this is a smart way to go . even if you only use half of the yeast in the next two years which is about the truly active lifespan of the yeast after opening a fresh pouch , you have come out ahead . just keep it dry , cool and if you can , vacuum sealed for protection .",

        "full text doc": "queen village animal hospital contacted about 15 days after stella's surgery to take a look at how it was healing and take the stitches out. they immediately asked for me to remove this review. i told my fiance i would not remove it because i would never want anyone to go through what we did. in response to qv's work on her eye, it is possible that a \" trained vet \" could see that her lower eyelid needed to be corrected ( and it will never be known to us if it was a mistake made or just a last minute switch ) but the point is any professional vet should have informed us of the change. last night qv actually had the nerve to call my fiance last night ( which is what prompted me to write this update ) and threaten him that if he didn't have me take this review down they were going to file a lawsuit against us. my fiance actually had to hang up on them and they still called back to leave a threatening voice mail. my advice? take your business elsewhere. stella's eye still has a blue tinge but seems like it's healing. we will be taking her to a new vet."

( or provolone or american if you're some sort of commie. ) you pull up to the window, state your order as quickly as possible in the official cheese steak lingo, and you move along before the people behind you start grumbling. all of this is beautiful and well worth treasuring - - one of the great food traditions in a nation full of great food traditions. one thing cannot be disputed : frankie's treasures the tradition. the cheese steaks are served on authentic amoroso rolls flown in from philadelphia. a poster on the wall explains how to place your order in the correct lingo."

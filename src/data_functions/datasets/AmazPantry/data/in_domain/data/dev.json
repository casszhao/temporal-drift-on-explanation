        "text": "like the wand itself ( which you 'll need to use these refills the way they are intended ) , these refills were on sale with prime pantry so i thought i 'd try them . i should state that i normally use seventh generation toilet bowl cleaner ( and a regular brush ) , so this product was quite a departure from what i 'm used to , but i figured i would give it a try and maybe use it for quick cleaning when i was in a hurry . in short , i am not impressed with this product -- the wand or the \" sponges \" ( these refills , a few of which come with the original wand ) , and here are my reasons why . first , the disposable \" sponge \" you attach to the handle is very small . this is adequate for cleaning the bowl where there is no water ( and i think it works decently under the rim , unlike some other reviewers , though a brush can do more ) and should work well for most of the bowl if you manage to mostly drain it first , though you need some water to \" activate \" the cleaning product on the sponge . however , seems too small and perhaps not abrasive enough to adequately clean near the \" drain \" area at the bottom of the bowl , which is where i find hard water deposits . it also works poorly to remove the hard water deposits at the top of the water line in the bowl , even if i try to let the cleaner soak in the bowl for a while . second , the cleaning product built into these sponges is apparently dyed blue , which darkens the water to such an extent that it 's hard to see what you 're doing in the bowl and whether your efforts to clean are actually making a difference . third , the cleaner is very bubbly , which also makes it hard to see what you 're doing ( i know , i know , people think that bubbles mean that it 's working , but other products i use bubble less and still clean effectively ) . finally , i do n't think germaphobes will appreciate this product as much as they think they will : because the sponge is so small , some of the handle will have to get dipped in the water in order for you to clean , especially at the bottom of the bowl -- although i guess the handle is easier to clean than a brush . ( just make sure it 's dry before you put it back in the holder or it will drip onto the floor . personally , i spray the handle with a disinfecting spray and let it dry before i place it back . ) in the future , i will stick with my other cleaning products . the \" natural \" cleaners i 've used clean just as well , if not better , and i find a traditional brush more effective at cleaning and easier to use .",

( at my last physical exam , i was diagnosed with a vitamin d deficiency . ) therefore , i do n't need the sunscreen . for those who labor outside and have raw , rough skin , then i highly recommend the men daily face lotion with qqq . for desk jockeys like me , the men qqq - qqq daily lotion will suffice . both are white and creamy , fragrance free , easy to apply , and are quickly absorbed into my skin . furthermore , i have n't experienced any ill side effects or allergic reactions from using either product . on the other hand , someone like my live - in girlfriend , tammy , will definitely benefit from the cetaphil men daily face lotion with spf qqq . she suffers with dry skin and spends practically every day in her parents ' swimming pool between memorial day and labor day .",

( probably better for the wound too ) . a good size selection , they stick , and they flex as described . i like them and would buy again !",

( lol ) ... that 's not how you lose weight with this product , it 's a meal replacement , not a side - dish ! that said , it does taste very good . the best way to mix it ( in my opinion ) is to add it to an extra tall glass of milk ( leave room to spare while stirring ) . stir very well for a full minute , then let it sit for a few minutes . it thickens up on its own to a nice consistency . drink it slowly , a sip or two every minute or two . it tastes delicious and is quite satisfying . it leaves me feeling as if i 've just had a decent sized meal . when you stick to the plan , losing weight becomes a reality instead of a dream . you 'll feel great ! you may even be motivated to start jogging or working out !

( on the plus side , they were not hard to bite into or chew , which is a criticism i have of some of the other varieties of kind bar . ) i guess the inclusion of cranberries and macadamia nuts makes the difference ( i do find macadamia nuts to be \" softer \" than almonds ) . i thought this tasted good . it was sweet ( as you might expect with an item that contains dried fruit ) but not overly sweet . one bar does contain qqq grams of sugars , which are primarily going to be added sugars . these are somewhat lower in fat ( and saturated fat ) than regular kind bars , but i would not call them a \" low fat \" food . here are the ingredients since i did n't see them on the product page : almonds , dried cranberries ( cranberries , sugar ) , macadamias , honey , non gmo glucose , crisp rice , chicory root fiber , sunflower oil . vitamins : vitamin a ( vit . a acetate ) , vitamin c ( ascorbic acid ) , vitamin e ( d - alpha tocopheryl acetate ) . so these contain tree nuts . they 're also vegetarian , but not vegan ( due to the honey ) . i found the ingredients to be fresh and of good quality ( i ate mine about a year before the expiration date printed on the individual bar wrapping ) . i have a ton more flavors of these to try but i do like this one quite a bit .",

( and trust me , one container never makes it a week here ) . also , it would be a real pain to have to tear open one of those tight sleeves that sticks like this in the stores come in every time you want one . i prefer them being loose . all in all a darn good and tasty stick of beef that may be a little greasier than most , but well worth the price they are asking ... recommended .. : )",

        "text": "i 've been eating this and and competing similar products as a part of a dietary meal plan , so i thought i 'd share my experience . i 'm not going to focus on nutritional details since that 's readily available on the package . instead i 'm focusing solely on subjective experience , and since i ordered a wide variety of similar products i 'm going to use a standard template because i 'm lazy that way . preparation : unlike the other entrees i 've been eating , this one had some assembly required . opening the package reveals a covered bowl containing a large plastic package of noodles , a smaller plastic package of teriyaki sauce , and two tiny foil packages containing dried vegetables and sesame seeds . the instructions called for putting the noodles in first , then the vegetables , then the teriyaki sauce , then two tablespoons of water , cover loosely with the lid , and microwave on high for qqq seconds . given that the vegetables were dried i opted to put them in first ( so the water would have a better chance of reaching them ) and that worked well . heating time was accurate ; qqq seconds in a qqq microwave oven on a rotating plate , followed by a one minute rest , perfectly heated the entree . observations : the vegetables are an honest - to - goodness joke . i understand that they need to be so tiny in order to properly rehydrate during preparation , but the quantity of vegetables is so tiny and their contribution to the dish is so meaningless that i do n't even really understand why they 're included in the first place . there 's maybe a tablespoon of vegetables in here and they add nothing in terms of flavor or texture and almost nothing in appearance . the teriyaki sauce is thicker than i would have preferred , and is not as strong as the teriyaki sauces you might encounter in a restaurant . i prefered this , actually , since i 'm not a big fan of strong teriyaki sauces . the noodles , of course , are the star of this dish ... but it 's a dim star . the noodles are gummy and sticky with an unpleasant rubbery feel in the mouth . the teriyaki sauce helps reduce the stickiness of the noodles but not enough . partway through the dish i added a tiny bit of sesame oil to what was left and gave it a good stir ; that helped quite a bit , though the unpleasant mouth feel remained . the sesame seeds were nothing special but did add a bit of welcome texture variation . verdict : not really digging this one and likely wo n't re - order it . the mouth feel of the noodles really spoils any hope for improvement of this dish , but i do think there is room for improvement . doubling or even tripling the vegetables would go a long way , i think , and even though this is a vegan dish i think it would be a lot more satisfying with a couple ounces of chicken in there .",

        "text": "i find the different options for biokleen laundry detergent a little confusing but their own website clarifies this fairly well . there are three options : qqq ) free and clear is the most popular option and contains their basic set of ingredients such as sodium carbonate , surfactant , hydrogen peroxide , etc . qqq ) citrus essence contains all of the ingredients of free and clear , plus one extra : orange peel extract . that s the only difference the scent . qqq ) premium plus contains the ingredients of free and clear , plus three extra : orange peel extract , proteases ( these are enzymes which can digest protein - based stains on clothes ) , and oxygen bleach ( which is sodium percarbonate ) . so , it comes down to this : if you do n't want the citrus scent then choose free and clear . if you do n't mind the scent then , of the remaining two options , i would recommend the premium plus . that s what i m using at the moment . a word about the extra ingredients : the proteases are produced by fermentation ( of yeast or bacteria ) and are not harmful to the environment . the oxygen bleach is sodium percarbonate , which is actually sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide mixed together . sodium carbonate is made from salt and limestone and is environmentally safe while hydrogen peroxide is manufactured from water and air using a catalyst ( which is recycled ) and then breaks down into water during your wash . incidentally , ewg previously gave a d grade to biokleen detergents , but they have since received more information on the formulations and have upgraded them to a for human safety . ewg are sometimes sketchy in this case they gave a d grade because the ingredient surfactant could be any one of a thousand things , some of which are harmful . now that they know the exact surfactant in the product they rate it as not harmful . the biokleen premium plus formulation is pretty similar to that of seventh generation , except that the seventh gen product has extra enzymes ( amylase for starchy stains ) . i like that company too but have n't tried their laundry detergent . i find the trend towards ultra - convenient products such as tide pods unsettling . are we really too lazy or incompetent to measure out some detergent ? the gel that encases these pods is of some concern and their use of bright dyes to make their detergent more eye - catching is also unnecessary . the water soluble gel used in pods is composed of polyvinyl alcohol , made from polymers of vinyl acetate which dow chemical states is highly toxic to fish and can cause cancer . is this risk really worth the benefit of not having to measure a scoop of detergent ? besides that , p&g do still conduct some animal testing not for tide , but i still do n't want to support them . i think biokleen is one of the most socially and environmentally responsible laundry detergents out there . they purchase wind power credits to offset their energy usage and also contribute to a river water restoration project ( and use cold water for their manufacturing process in washington ) . their ingredients and final products are not tested on animals and they use compostable or recyclable materials for the majority of their packaging . the biokleen laundry powders are extremely concentrated , reducing energy used for shipping as well as packaging materials ( which is a bare minimum of a cardboard box and plastic bag ) . one note on the product concentration some people reported their clothes smelling bad ( or about the same as pre - wash smell ) after washing , even if they use twice as much detergent . using more than the recommended amount of detergent is actually the cause of the smell , because you end up with excess surfactant left over on your clothes . you can think of this surfactant as fat , basically , which will turn rancid ( smelly ) and encourage bacterial growth . i use half a scoop in a front - loading he washing machine and have no complaints . overall , i prefer the premium plus option but have found the free and clear and citrus essence varieties to be good too . i rate all of them qqq gold stars for price and quality and qqq green stars for social and environmental responsibility .",

( insofar as its certified by quality assurance international ) -with qqq cholesterol , it may be a good choice for someone seeking a crumbly bar , without much taste , that does nt raise cholesterol maybe for someone just seeking to fill their belly ? qqq g of protein , which is more than probably half the other granola bars on the market . the bad : -it claims its chewy , but its definitely more akin to crumbly . by simply removing the bar from the wrapper , it falls apart . -its extremely bland . i get it , it uses a bunch of healthier grains and ingredients , but as someone who organically gardens that does nt mean it has to be so flavorless and bland . -limited chocolate taste and absolutely qqq pomegranate taste . chocolate is listed as the fourth ingredient and pomegranates at the seventh . -quite simply , it tastes bland , but also a little bit stale . not a very appetizing taste . the verdict : not a good option for someone backpacking , as it crumbles at the slightly touch , so i ca nt imagine it ll hold well crammed into a backpack . i think it would prove a decent option for someone wanting to add chewiness to their cereal , if there are such people on this earth , without adding a ton of sweetness . since its not a very sweet bar , or actually all that flavorful in any way , shape , or form , it may alternatively prove to be an okay additive to muffins or cookies , if you 're on some sort of health kick and you want to add more grains to your diet .",

( yes, i'm thinking of shapiro's if we're talking cafeterias ). here are some examples of vastly superior places for brunch / lunch or just cafeteria or breakfast food : 1. good morning mama's. still better. still cheaper. no hype. 2. milktooth. if you're going to spend money, might as well spend it on a high quality place. 3. the garden table. better compared to patachou in every way. compare the salads in either place and you'll come running back here. 4. love handle. for $ 14, shouldn't you just get their waffle with pork belly and call it a day? the same item at patachou would be"

        "full text doc": "this was the worst service experience i've had in recent memory, and the most surprising thing is how unapologetic they were through it all. the morning i called about our washing machine not working, they said they could come by later that morning. i called back around 3 : 30 after not hearing anything all morning. they said they hadn't forgotten about me. didn't hear anything the rest of that day or the next. the third day they called to say they were coming between 10 - 12. the tech that showed up looked at the washer for maybe 3 minutes. he didn't test anything. simply turned the machine on and watched it turn itself off which we'd described over the phone. he went out to his van, and came back with a $ 500 quote. he said the main board was bad and asked for payment for the $ 99 dollar service fee like he was in a hurry. i later called his supervisor who i had been \" communicating \" with. he was unapologetic and defended the quick diagnosis. said they're highly trained to be able to quickly diagnose issues. turns out, i had an issue with my electrical circuit. absolutely nothing wrong with my washer. we've run"

        "full text doc": "because lunch, dinner, and a snack during the daytime is never enough for us, we ordered from fresco late night during our stay in nola to top everything off for the day. i could personally order pizza every day for a year probably but my gf is more civilized and on this particular occasion we decided to go the pasta route. we ordered pesto pasta, a veggie wrap, and spinach and feta triangles. the pesto was tasty with a touch of cream in the sauce. the pasta could have been more al dente but ultimately i can never go wrong with pesto. scattered roasted red pepper strips added some variety. i adored the veggie wrap with hummus, roasted red peppers, roasted eggplant, baby spinach, kalamata olives, and feta which with the sundried tomato mayo was decadent and creamy and paired perfectly surrounded by a soft and warm pita. gf for some reason wasn't a fan which escapes my comprehension. i was way too stuffed to finish the whole thing which is a big regret for me. the actual best dish of the meal was their spinach and feta triangles with sauteed spinach and feta cheese stuffed into phyllo dough."

        "full text doc": "i will say this, i've never given a 5 star review and then have something i don't like, but i'll get to that in a bit. first, service was outstanding and very pleasant. very attentive with refills. kevin always made sure we were take. care of. appetizers and salads were tasty. my wife got a house salad and i got the crab cakes. if you like seafood, you would like the cakes. entrees were also amazing. wife had a 10oz sirloin and i had the flounder. both of which cut like butter. i am still going to give this place five stars but i will say the dessert room was super disappointing. we were better off just stopping at dairy queen. everything we tried was just dry and flavorless. just a personal opinion, i wouldn't recommend visiting. everything else is off the five star scale."

        "full text doc": "wow a lot has changed in 5 years. i am still a know guest to ginza but after yesterday, and multiple other days of going in the past year, sad to say, ginza has officially fell off. everything use to be hot once the food came your table, steaming hot. for the past 3 - 4 time i have gone, nothing is the same anymore. i went there this past weekend and i had to say something, i never give back my food. i just was super disappointed that i've came here for years and to watch it become low quality every visit, it's just sad. the staff there also don't know how to handle guest communication and satisfaction. no apologies made at all. the manager honestly seemed like he wanted to argue, but i let him know although others haven't complained, i am. because i brought a friend along to try it out and it simply embarrassed me that the food was and never will be up to par. i'll go to zukkusan sushi bar and grill instead! my new favorite sushi place, more pricey but worth the price!"
